        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes enables teams to focus on developing innovative applications by simplifying deployment, scaling, and configuration through a simple yet flexible API. The system can support all types of applications: web apps, databases, distributed systems, or even VMs; and can do it on any cloud or bare-metal platform. Our vision is that every organization has access to this infrastructure technology, a mission we call #GIFEE: Google Infrastructure For Everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;But, as Kubernetes’s reach grows, what do real production applications look like? Where does Kubernetes need to go to continue supporting an ever-wider range?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join Brandon Philips for a look at the status of Kubernetes and at the roadmap for its future, including automated Kubernetes upgrades, management of complex applications, integration with cloud providers, and multi-cluster federation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Software Heritage: Preserving the Free Software Commons</title>
        <subtitle/>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) constitutes the bulk of the Software Commons, and is at the heart of our digital society.
We discuss why and how the Software Heritage project is taking over the mission of ensuring that this precious body of knowledge will be preserved over time and made available to all.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Software Commons is the vast body of human knowledge embedded in software source code, that is publicly available and can be freely altered and reused. Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) constitutes the bulk of it. Sadly we seem to be at increasing risk of losing this precious heritage built by the FOSS community over the paste decades: code hosting sites shut down when their popularity decreases, tapes of ancient versions of our toolchain (bit-)rot in basements, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ambitious goal of the &lt;a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org"&gt;Software Heritage&lt;/a&gt; project is to contribute to address this risk, by collecting, preserving, and sharing &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; publicly available software in source code form. Together with its complete VCS development history. Forever, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing so Software Heritage will serve the needs of: Society, by preserving our collective technological heritage; Industry, by building the largest software provenance open database; Science, by assembling the largest curated archive for software research; and Education, by creating the ultimate anthology for programming curricula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although still in Beta, Software Heritage has already archived more than 3 billion unique source code files and 700 million unique commits, spanning more than 45 million FOSS projects from major software development hubs, GNU/Linux distributions, and upstream software collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software Heritage is developed transparently as a collaborative project and all its own source code is available as FOSS under copyleft licenses. Currently incubated by &lt;a href="http://www.inria.fr/en"&gt;Inria&lt;/a&gt;, the project will graduate soon to an independent charitable, nonprofit organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>CloudABI: easily develop sandboxed apps for UNIX</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Cloud</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the fundamental problems with UNIX-like operating systems is that they don't seem to make it easy and intuitive to develop
applications that are strongly hardened against exploits through sandboxing. With CloudABI, we're trying to make this process a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CloudABI is a blend of POSIX and pure capability-based security, which allows you to create applications that are only capable of accessing those things that they are designed to use. As you'll see, software also becomes easier to test and deploy as a result of using this model.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I am going to discuss a project I've been working on over the last two years, called CloudABI. CloudABI is a simplified POSIX-like runtime environment that is inspired by FreeBSD's Capsicum. It allows you to create programs that can solely interact with the environment through file descriptors (capabilities). Compared to traditional UNIX-like systems, this approach has three advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reduces the impact of exploits. If an attacker manages to take over control of a CloudABI application, it can only access those resources that the application was designed to use (for a networked service: typically an already bound TCP socket and some data directories). This is different from most traditional UNIX-like systems, where an attacker would gain access to all resources that the user running the application can access, which is very broad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes applications easier to test. By knowing that an application can only access those resources that are provided explicitly, the entire environment in which the application runs can be customized for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it makes applications easier to deploy. This model tends to reduce the need for using containers and virtual machines. Applications can be started directly, while still providing the necessary isolation from the rest of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'm going to explain how CloudABI works in detail, while also discussing some of its design decisions. I'll also show how you can design your own CloudABI programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CloudABI is available for Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X. A NetBSD port also exists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Resurrecting dinosaurs, what can possibly go wrong?</title>
        <subtitle>How Containerised Applications could eat our users.</subtitle>
        <track>Cloud</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Containerised Application technologies like AppImage, Snappy and Flatpak promise a brave new world for Linux applications, free from the worries of shared libraries and dependency issues.
Just one problem, this is a road long travelled before, such as in the application dark ages of Win32 applications and DLLs. And it worked out so wonderfully there...
Do we risk a future where, like the resurrected dinosaurs of Jurassic Park, this family of applications will break their containment and start eating our users?
This session will try to present a balanced argument about the situation, frankly discussing the benefits promised by these technologies, but highlighting the very real issues and risks their widespread adoption could, and in some cases are, already bringing to the table.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk with cover the promised benefits of application containers, such as AppImage, Snappy and Flatpak.
It will detail the empowerment of developers who use the technologies, the ability for upstream projects to have a much closer role in delivering their software, and the benefits that brings to both the upstream projects and their users.
But as a counter to those benefits, the session will detail some of the risks and responsibilities that come with that technology. The complexities of library integration, the risk of introducing new forms of dependency issues, and the transference of responsibility for those issues, plus security, away from the current Distributions delivering upstream projects towards those upstream projects directly.
As a conclusion, the session will present some suggestions to upstream projects adopting these technologies to start them down the road of accepting those responsibilities directly, or working more closely with existing Distribution projects to share the burdens these technologies now provide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Thousands of contributors help building the curl software which runs on
several billions of devices and are affecting every human in the connected world
daily. How this came to happen, who contributes and how Daniel at the wheel
keeps it all together.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a description of a small project with a major reach. curl and libcurl
can probably be considered corner stones in a world of client-side Internet transfers
and in particular HTTP, running on every imaginable operating system and CPU
architecture in use today. Started in the late 90s, the software now runs in
billions of devices and is quite likely one of the most widely used software
components - any category. Daniel takes us through how it started, how it
works and why it never gets done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I've been working on a new system call ABI and the required runtime support for a C variant with spacial memory safety.  Along the way I've encountered lots of interesting bits and pieces required to implement a simple C "Hello, World" program.  I found the process fascinating so this talk brings all that knowledge together in one place.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first example in the classic "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie is in fact a remarkably complete test of the C programming language.  This talk provides a guided tour a slightly more complex program where printf() is called with multiple arguments.  Along the way from the initial processes' call to exec() to the final _exit(), we'll tour the program loading code in the kernel and the dynamic linker, the basics of system call implementation, the implementation of the memory allocator, and of course printf().  We'll also touch on localization and a little on threading support.  Where appropriate, I'll discuss portions of the system that need changing to accommodate memory safe versions of C like the version we are developing for our CHERI CPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will assume some knowledge of a language with C-like syntax (C, C++, Java, and PHP should all be fine).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Ethics in Network Measurements </title>
        <subtitle>Moral obligations of engineers, scientists and hackers, based on example of RIPE Atlas </subtitle>

        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When designing technologies, networked systems, and measurements on the Internet, we must be aware of their implications and consequences for the society and participants. As engineers, scientists, programmers and other experts, we have moral obligations towards our peers, users of technologies we create, and the wider communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I want to talk both about general ethical considerations, and specific examples of moral dilemmas that come from building the RIPE Atlas system, and conducting measurements that reveal workings of Internet infrastructure and services.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RIPE Atlas is an extensive measurement network, where the vantage points (sources of measurements) are hosted by volunteers: mostly individuals at home, but also some institutions (ISPs, IXPs, academia, various other businesses). RIPE Atlas users are using someone else's Internet connection to do measurements. In order to recognise ethical considerations surrounding use of RIPE Atlas, we looked both into the historical considerations of engineers and scientists, and into practical constraints users should keep in mind, and we published some findings in this article:

        <title>All Ages: How to Build a Movement</title>

        <track>Miscellaneous</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We want the free software movement to keep growing and one facet of successful movement building is embracing a multi-generational community. The good news is that there is no age requirement for using, promoting and contributing to free software. The bad news is that we aren't always doing a great job of facilitating a diverse, inter-generational movement. We'll take a look at what we're currently doing to bring in young people, how we are treating older people in our communities and where there is room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using examples from other movements and inter-generational communities, we'll identify tactics that aren't being used to build the free software community and see what we can collectively port over. We plan to inspire the audience to find ways to recruit and retain young people, inspire older people to participate and maintain an unbroken thread of free software conservatorship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Veripeditus AR Game Framework</title>
        <subtitle>Enabling everyone to freely create Augmented Reality Games</subtitle>
        <track>Miscellaneous</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When the Ingress game started in 2013, quite a few people world-wide found out that augmented reality gaming in the real world was a great new invention, and the game grew to become a success for the then-project inside Google. With its Pokémon themed update in 2016, Niantic got the whole world playing - and sponsoring them with all their personal details. Veripeditus opens up the world of AR game creation to the public.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pokémon Go hype is spreading and more and more people are playing - on a real map with real objects. With the ever growing possibilities of smart phones and apps, interest for Augmented Reality is getting bigger. But there are obvious problems: current developers don't care about privacy and data is collected, sold and freely provided to others at will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About time to make a change! Veripeditus is entirely free, open source software and easy to use. The server can be run entirely by yourself and everyone can develope games and custom clients if they wish. The frameworkd allows for the development of augmented reality games, so called "cartridges", that can be played in the real world in any scope, be it locally, like on the premises of a museum, or on global scope, like an augemented reality MMORPG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the development of Veripeditus, we aim at making game development as easy as possible. The only thing needed is basic knowledge of Python and, of course, ideas for the game. Veripeditus itself also employs basic, well-known technologies like a relational database, the SQLAlchemy object-relational mapper and a (glorified) RESTful API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will give an introduction to how Veripeditus was developed, how games can be created and what can be done with it - some ideas include using Veripeditus in education, local group activities, tourism amd, of course, plain fun gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also showcase a mini game that will be playable on the ULB campus!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>User Session Recording for the Enterprise</title>
        <subtitle>An Open-Source Effort by Red Hat</subtitle>
        <track>Miscellaneous</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Now, when many IT-related services are delegated to external parties, government, medical, financial, and other organizations need tight tracking of what users and administrators do on their critical systems. Up to recording everything they see on the screen, the commands they execute, and files they access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation Nikolai Kondrashov will review available solutions for user session recording, open-source and otherwise, their benefits and shortcomings, and will present a new effort to create an integrated Open-Source solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many capable solutions for session recording, which can centrally collect, search and playback sessions, there is no such open-source code. The best we have is jump servers with script(1), or sudo I/O logging, all manually set up. This presentation will show an approach that would meet the needs of the modern enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation will include a demo of a user session and accompanying data being recorded, stored centrally, inspected and played back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intended audience is developers of security, identity and policy management systems, as well as system administrators and security officers responsible for maintaining critical systems and preventing insider attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Never before it was so easy and inexpensive to gather, as well as generate, massive amounts of data. Often, data get discretized in space and time, nat­ur­ally leading to multi-dimensional arrays. In fact, arrays play a core role in most domains of science, engineering, and bus­in­ess - generally speak­ing, spatio-temporal sensor, image, time­series, sim­­ul­ation, and statistics data­. This raises the need for flexible, scalable, and open services in replacement of the bespoke silo solutions that have prevailed in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional databases have been successful due to their flexibility (through query languages) and scalability (through manifold optimizations and parallelization in the server) - however, they unfortunately do not support massive arrays. This is being remedied within ISO currently where SQL/MDA ("Multi-Dimensional Arrays") is in an advanced stage, likely becoming adopted in summer 2017. SQL/MDA adds declarative array definition and operations to SQL. Not only paves this the way for powerful services, maybe even more important it allows, for the first time, integrating data and metadata into the same archive, even in one and the same query. As such, SQL/MDA will be a game changer in data services not only for science and engineering at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We present the concepts and rationales, as well as the open-source technology rasdaman ("raster data manager") which is serving as the blueprint for MDA.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We have learnt to live with the pain of separating data and metadata into non-interoperable silos. For metadata, we enjoy the flexibility of databases, be they relational, graph, or some other NoSQL. Contrasting this, users still "drown in files" as an unstructured, low-level archiving paradigm. It is time to bridge this chasm which once was technologically induced, but today can be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One building block towards a common re-integrated information space is to support massive multi-dimensional spatio-temporal arrays. These "datacubes" appear as sensor, image, simulation, and statistics data in all science and engineering domains, and beyond. For example, 2-D satellilte imagery, 2-D x/y/t image timeseries and x/y/z geophysical voxel data, and 4-D x/y/z/t climate data contribute to today's data deluge in the Earth sciences. Virtual observatories in the Space sciences routinely generate Petabytes of such data. Life sciences deal with microarray data, confocal microscopy, human brain data, which all fall into the same category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ISO SQL/MDA (Multi-Dimensional Arrays) candidate standard is extending SQL with modelling and query support for n-D arrays ("datacubes") in a flexible, domain-neutral way. This heralds a new generation of services with new quality parameters, such as flexibility, ease of access, embedding into well-known user tools, and scalability mechanisms that remain completely transparent to users. Technology like the EU rasdaman ("raster data manager") Array Database system can support all of the above examples simultaneously, with one technology. This is practically proven: As of today, rasdaman is in operational use on hundreds of Terabytes of satellite image timeseries datacubes, with transparent query distribution across more than 1,000 nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Array Databases offering SQL/MDA constitute a natural common building block for next-generation data infrastructures. Being initiator and editor of the standard we present principles, implementation facets, and application examples as a basis for further discussion. Time allowing we will present live demos from services exceeding 20 TB of "datacubes".&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will present the mechanisms of Bazel, Google's own build tool.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Bazel is Google's own build tool, open-sourced in February 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bazel has built-in support for building both client and server software, including
client applications for both Android and iOS platforms. It also provides an
extensible framework that you can use to develop your own build rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will present the mechanisms that enable Bazel to deal with the
scale of software made at Google while guaranteeing reproducibility of
builds. It will also cover the challenges the Bazel team faced to
open-source such a large tool and the future of the Bazel project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Continuous integration brought us fast reliable and continuous testing.  Continuous localisation brings the same speed and delivery to the translation of software.  We'll look at how to build such a process using FOSS tools.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuous localisation is becoming more critical to the software delivery process.  And just like continuous inegration we rely on a number of tools and automation to ensure that we deliver good translations quickly to products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll be looking at continuous localisation processes using FOSS tools and mapping the parallels between modern software development and continuous localisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll cover aspects such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing/Checking and building automated linguistic and stylistic checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated and bidirectional synchronisation between the translation tools and software repos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building in processes for content review both in source and target text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encouraging translator participation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivering translations quickly and continuously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And for FOSS projects we'll show how to implement a process using FOSS tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Drones have become ubiquitous: from small toys to remote piloted aircrafts, they are not uncommon anymore.
FOSS is fundamental for the drone (or UAV) environment: several drone platforms are based on it, like Dronecode and various autopilot systems.
The talk will address the possible interactions with FOSS drone components, and the pressing issues of security and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Drones were, not many years ago, an exotic item, straight from SF movies.
In very few years, they have become ubiquitous, and FOSS has played a fundamental role in this very fast expansion.
Several important drone platforms and software rely on FOSS components, and one of the most prominent projects, Dronecode, is governed by the Linux Foundation.
The expansion of drones has triggered a regulatory frenzy, not only at the national level, but also at the European one: EASA (the European Aviation Safety Authority) has already released the second draft of the ‘Prototype’ Commission Regulation on Unmanned Aircraft Operations, which may be approved during 2017, while the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 has several articles which have a direct influence on the developing of drones. Principles like data protection by design and data protection by default cannot be ignored for developers involved in FOSS drone platforms.
The talk will examine the current (and future) European Legal framework, in order to assess the interactions between EU safety security and privacy regulations, and the “FOSS powered” development of drones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;If you run an open source project, and you'd like to get contributions from employees at medium-to-large companies, the simplest way to provide a smooth contribution process is to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use a Contributor License Agreement. If your project requires one, though, there are steps you can take to ease the burden this causes on contributions from company employees, and this talk will cover a number of issues encountered during 4+ years of managing contributions from a 20K+ employee global company.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While there is a growing movement in the open source community away from Contributor License Agreements, many important projects still require them. Some of these projects are focused on 'enterprise' usage, so as a result employees of major companies want to contribute. However, the mechanisms used to execute these CLAs vary widely (it seems that every project builds its own CLA system), and none of them take into account the various legal and logistical requirements of a major corporation who wants to contribute. This talk will present a series of problems encountered as a contributing company, and propose ways that CLA-requiring projects can resolve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems include (but are no means limited to): requiring the agreement to be executed on a social media platform; providing no ability for the authorized signer and the manager of the authorized employee list to be different people; requiring FAXed copies of agreements; failing to provide the ability to authorize employees to contribute to specific codebases within a large project; and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many projects start out with the intention of staying single license FOSS projects. As your project grows, reality hits: some components or files may need to use different licenses than originally anticipated. There are many reasons why this can happen: you may need to interface with projects of another license, you may want to import code from other projects or your developers may not understand the subtleties of the licenses in use. Besides the obvious challenges of managing mixed license FOSS projects, such as license compatibility and tracking what licenses you use, you are running the risk of exposing your project to unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will explore unintended consequences, risks and best practices using some examples from the recent history of the Xen Project. In particular we will cover:
1) Refactoring can lead to licensing changes: best practices and unintended consequences when importing code from elsewhere. Making code archeology easy from a licensing perspective and why it is important.
2) A worked example of a license change of a key component: process, pain points, their causes and how they could have been avoided
3) The perils of LGPL/GPL vX (or Later): the unintended consequences of not providing pre-defined copyright headers in your source base&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will conclude with a summary of lessons and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source license compliance has become more complex as time progresses.   Using open source tools and open standards (SPDX), we should be able to make it easy to comply with the terms of the licenses specified in the code,  and not require expensive proprietary technologies.   This talk will outline some steps that will help to make license compliance more transparent, and with automation, make it easy to fulfill the obligations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using an openly developed standard (SPDX),  and open source tooling it is now possible to generate accurate summary information for a project with open source tools, that can be shared with those that use the project.   Software development today builds thousand of open source components that developers have shared,  tools permit composition of new interfaces from code from many sources,  conveying the licensing information hasn't always been a priority for developers, and as a result there's a fair amount of ambiguity out there that needs sophisticated proprietary tooling to decipher the actual licenses in effect.   By leveraging automation to generate this information when a project builds, it ensures that the intentions of the authors are accurate and can easily be respected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will overview the problem scope and then propose some open source tools that can help with the automation part using open standards to improve the transparency of the information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It is generally assumed that free and open source communities are best served by governance rules that are open and transparent. I will argue that while openness and transparency are necessary, they are not sufficient. Particularly as the number of open source communities governed by trade associations grows, additional principles are necessary such as vendor neutrality, and ensuring a level playing field. This talk will provide an overview of the (often legal) control points that exist in open communities, and various strategies used by corporations to seize them. It will also provide some examples of existing community governance rules which openly and transparently ensure special rights to particular organizations. A few simple governance hacks to help make trade associations better stewards of open communities will also be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) are becoming more broadly deployed (sometimes as part of proprietary systems) amongst organisations who have limited pre-understanding of the philosophy underlying FOSS there are a number of challenges which need to be successfully addressed. Such challenges include licensing obligations for FOSS and a number of associated legal issues, such as patents, trademarks, procurement law, and various conditions (e.g. FRAND-terms) for use of standards. Many companies and public sector organisations struggle with these challenges and there are sometimes tensions and legal disputes between different interests, which may involve organisations and individuals contributing to specific open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This panel seeks to address the following overarching question:
Which are the contemporary legal and policy challenges needed to be better understood through systematic research studies, and what relevant studies should be designed and conducted in order to produce relevant research results as well as practical outcomes in order to shed light on these challenges?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The (45 minutes) panel will start with short position statements by the panellists and a dialogue between them. Significant time will be allocated to an open discussion on the issues with the audience, and those attending are invited to raise their own concerns and share their own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;During the last few years there has been significant debate over
approaches to GPL enforcement in technical and legal communities. This
talk presents a new and unique vendor perspective on free software
license enforcement that emphasizes the goal of fostering greater
collaboration and participation in community development and
highlights the importance of transparency regarding funding
relationships and conflicts of interest arising out of enforcement
activities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the last few years there has been significant debate over
approaches to GPL enforcement in developer and legal communities. This
talk presents a unique vendor perspective on free software license
enforcement that has been shaped by deep organizational involvement in
free software development, longstanding cultural ties to GPL-using
communities, and a strong corporate emphasis on ethical conduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where compliance efforts adhere strictly to certain principles, they
can provide a legitimate mechanism for ensuring that everyone plays by
the rules established by the community through the license. But the
ultimate objective of enforcement should be to foster greater
collaboration and participation in community development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Principles of Community-Oriented GPL Enforcement published in 2015 by the Software Freedom Conservancy and Free Software Foundation
represent a good first step in articulating an appropriately
principled basis for copyleft enforcement. However, there are some
gaps in the Principles that should be addressed by communities
supportive of license enforcement. In particular, for enforcement to
have community legitimacy, there needs to be an expectation of
disclosure of funding relationships and exposure and resolution of the
potential conflicts of interest that may arise in enforcement
activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What does it look like when we apply Open Source software licenses and practices to hardware? How do authors intend for Open Source licenses and copyleft principles to apply to hardware, across its many types of components and interconnects, and what legal frameworks can preserve that intent? Hardware raises new scenarios and questions; how might we extrapolate our principles to them? We'll propose some use cases to explore intent and ideal outcomes, and invite discussion on how to get there.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The first hardware-focused Open Source activities started around 20 years ago. But even as open hardware itself matures, the legal aspects remain relatively unexplored, and many unanswered legal questions remain. We'll examine what "licensing" means in terms of hardware, and discuss the adequacy of currently available mechanisms to express the intent of the authors and creators of open hardware. From our experience in Open Source software, we naturally attempt to find parallels in software licenses that can be applied to hardware; however, hardware designs introduce new aspects that have no equivalent in the software world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, we're especially interested in how the ideas and principles of copyleft translate.  How do things like linking, derivative works, and compilation operate in terms of hardware? What "exclusive rights" belong to authors and makers in this domain, and can we offer a license to those rights the same way we can for software copyrights? What rights do builders/fabricators have? How does a license on a digital description affect the manufacture, distribution, and copying of the corresponding physical objects it describes? How do the various types of components within an open hardware design interact, and how do the licenses of those components interact over the many ways of connecting those components together? And can we apply or adapt existing Open Source software licenses for hardware, without fragmenting the ecosystem between software and hardware, especially as the lines between the two become increasingly fluid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll explore each of these areas, using as a case study the creation, licensing, and distribution of a product incorporating both open software and many types of open hardware.  We'll offer our thoughts on some possible properties of an ideal open hardware licensing framework, seek consensus on how our principles apply in various concrete scenarios, and invite discussion on how our legal structures can adapt to serve the needs of the developing Open Source hardware world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Tom Callaway, the Fedora Legal chair, will talk about the past, present, and future of licensing and legal issues in the Fedora community. Tom is not a lawyer, nor does he play one on TV, but he does consult with lawyers, and occasionally, go drinking with them. Bring your questions, and he'll do his best to answer them. I am not a lawyer, so nothing in my presentation should be (or could be) construed as legal advice.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fedora, as the evolution of Red Hat Linux, is one of the oldest and most well known Linux distributions in existence today. For more than 10 years, I have been the Fedora Legal representative who investigates licenses, negotiates with lawyers, advises our community, and does everything in my power to not have to tell people "no" without a very good reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my presentation, I'll discuss the past, present, and future of licensing and legal issues in the Fedora community (and beyond). I'm also happy to take questions from the FOSDEM audience as to why Fedora does what it does (or doesn't do what it doesn't do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a lawyer, so nothing in my presentation should be (or could be) construed as legal advice. I am however, a well informed hacker, and the editor/maintainer of possibly the largest list of FOSS licenses in existence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Radio Lockdown Directive</title>
        <subtitle>Major threat for Free Software on radio devices</subtitle>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since June 2014 we face an EU directive that threatens all wireless devices. The Radio Equipment Directive requires all devices that are able to send and receive radio signals to be locked down. This goes much further than the FCC lockdown in the US since it doesn't only affect routers but also mobile phones, GPS receivers, and amateur radio operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From June 2017 hardware manufacturers will be forced to install technical measurements to protect the devices from being flashed with "non-compliant" software: firmware that hasn't been checked by the manufacturer to comply with applicable radio regulations (e.g. signal strenght, frequences). Many European states already have implemented the directive in national law without many ways how to circumvent the major lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we have identified possible ways how to excluded certain classes of devices from this directive. The speaker will evaluate the current situation, present additional findings and opinions of political and economic actors, and exchange ideas and knowledge with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;More and more devices connect to the Internet and each other using wireless and mobile networks. These include countless devices such as routers, mobile phones, WiFi-cards and laptops. All of them, as well as all Internet-of-Things devices, today and in the future, fall under the regulation of the Radio Equipment Directive 2014/53/EU (hereinafter ‘the Directive’), adopted in May 2014 by the European Parliament and the European Council. The main purposes of the Directive are harmonisation of existing regulations, improving security of radio spectra, and protection of health and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people agree to general purpose of the Directive. However, we express our concerns over the far-reaching consequences of Article 3(3)(i) of the Directive, which require device manufacturers to check each device software's compliance in order to comply with the Directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Threats of Radio Lockdown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe such requirement has negative implications on users' rights and Free Software, fair competition, innovation, environment, and volunteering – mostly without comparable benefits for security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article 3(3)(i) require device manufacturers to assess software for compliance with existing national radio regulations, a requirement which will keep users and companies from upgrading the software on devices they own, unless that software is assessed by the original manufacturer. This not only is a severe burden for device manufacturers themselves but also violating the customers' rights of free choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirement enshrined in Article 3(3)(i) will impact the freedom to conduct business of many companies relying on the abillity to provide alternative and Free Software firmware on devices. Alternative software is the foundation of many companies' products, and we should prevent economic disadvantages for these businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burdensome requirements to check every possible software's compliance will also have negative implications on innovation and charitable non-profit organisations who rely on software other than the manufacturers'. Efforts of volunteer associations helping people in need to connect to the internet, may be rendered void or severely handicapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, alternative software on radio devices also promotes a sustainable economy. There are many devices still in working order which do not receive updates from the original manufacturers anymore, hence alternative software developed and improved by community efforts (such as Free Software) has a much longer support period which prevent users and customers having to dispose of still working equipment. In return, this also improves the security of users since older hardware still receives security updates after a manufacturer stops supporting those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are in favor of the Directive's aim to improve security of radio devices but not at the unbalanced expense of users' freedom and security in other areas. Firstly, upgrading the software of a device mostly helps increasing the devices' security. Secondly, we are convinced that such strict regulations are not necessary for typical consumer products with limited radio output power. And thirdly, we believe that such technical restrictions will not hinder people willingly violating applicable radio regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our Proposals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we ask EU institutions and the Member States to take these concerns into consideration and ensure that the Directive does not place blanket, unnecessary and disproportionate restrictions on the rights of consumers and businesses when implementing the Directive into national legislations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Understanding The Complexity of Copyleft Defense</title>
        <subtitle>After 25 Years of GPL Enforcement, Is Copyleft Succeeding?</subtitle>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;After 25 years of copyleft enforcement and compliance work, is copyleft
succeeding as a strategy to defend software freedom?  This talk explores the
history of enforcement of the GPL and other copyleft licenses, and considers
this question carefully.  Attendees who have hitherto not followed the
current and past debates about copyleft licenses and their enforcement can
attend this talk and learn the background, and can expect to learn enough to
provide salient and informed feedback of their own opinions about the
processes behind upholding copyleft.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.en.html"&gt;first GPL enforcement action was done by Richard Stallman against NeXT Computers in 1989&lt;/a&gt;, regarding Objective C support in GCC.  For 25 years, GPL
enforcement has remained a regular but rarely mainstream activity in Open
Source and Free Software projects.  Very few projects enforce their &lt;a href="https://copyleft.org/"&gt;copyleft&lt;/a&gt;
licenses; most live with regular violations and merely ignore them, or simply
beg violators to comply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even under the now-published and publicly discussed &lt;a href="https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/principles.html"&gt;Community Principles of GPL Enforcement&lt;/a&gt;,
co-drafted by Software Freedom Conservancy and the Free Software Foundation,
GPL enforcement is regularly criticized and questioned.  Those of us who
enforce the GPL get wildly inconsistent feedback from the community: some&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;copyright holders recruit organizations like Conservancy and FSF to enforce
as much as possible, others often complaining that we simply don't enforce
enough, and still others call for a complete moratorium on GPL enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, not all enforcement abides by community principles.  For-profit
enforcers, who have existed for decades, use copyleft licenses in a manner
not intended by the license drafters: to captiously convince "customers" that
they must buy proprietary licenses, or otherwise pay, to incorporate Open
Source and Free Software into their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This complex landscape has become almost impenetrable for the average FLOSS
developers who merely wish their code to remain forever free and libre.  This
talk will provide the basic history and background information about the
state of copyleft in our community, and set the stage for all developers to
give informed feedback to organizations that stand up for copyleft.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Diagnosing Issues in Java Apps using Thermostat and Byteman.</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Free Java</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Thermostat is a monitoring and management tool for Java deployments,
allowing users to measure and monitor a host of different performance
aspects of their Java applications. Available metrics range from raw
CPU and memory usage to operation of the Garbage Collector and JIT
compiler through to thread activity and method call/heap profiles.
Thermostat provides a GUI view of activity of local and distributed
JVMs in a live-view or, alternatively, offline for after-the-fact
analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Thermostat cannot do on its own is track events and record
statistics that are specific to a given Java application, at least not
unless the application co-operates with it, for example by publishing
JMX statistics that Thermostat can read, persist and display in its
GUI. However, that's about to change thanks to work Thermostat
developers have been doing to integrate Byteman into Thermostat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Byteman is a tool which can be used to modify the behaviour of Java
programs by injecting extra Java code almost anywhere in the program.
You don't need to recompile your program or even prepare it in advance
in order for this to work. You can specify changes to the program on
the command line but, what is more amazing, you can actually use
Byteman to change the way a program runs after startup while it is
still running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will show how Thermostat can collect and visualize
metrics with Byteman's help in order to better understand a specific
performance issue in a Java application.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The HotSpot JIT compilers use a lot of sophisticated
optimization techniques to speed up your Java code. Sometimes, these
advanced optimizations are so aggressive that they may eliminate
required checks by mistake and therefore suppress expected
program errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I'll briefly introduce Escape Analysis and Intrinsics,
two commonly used HotSpot optimization techniques. I'll show how a
combination of these two features can optimize away
IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions in some corner cases where they are
required by the standard and how I fixed this error in recent versions
of the OpenJDK.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Shenandoah: Why Do We Need Yet Another Garbage Collector</title>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Garbage Collection (GC) liberates the programmer from having to call malloc and free. More importantly GC saves the programmer from having to debug their mistakes when using malloc and free. Unfortunately the details of how GC works are often a black box. This talk will start with a tour of all of the GC algorithms currently available in OpenJDK. We'll discuss how they work, their strengths and weaknesses, and which class of applications they were developed for. We'll work our way through serial gc, parallel gc, concurrent mark and sweep, and g1. We'll make the case for why we need all of them and just one more GC algorithm, Shenandoah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shenandoah is a parallel and concurrent GC algorithm designed for applications with 100gb+ heaps and tight pause time constraints. It's the first GC algorithm targeting OpenJDK which compacts the live objects while the Java threads are running. We'll describe the algorithm itself, the implementation details, and the optimizations needed to achieve good performance. We'll present performance numbers and give a demo that visualizes Shenandoah.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Three ideas for the G1 GC (and how to get involved)</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Free Java</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The G1 garbage collector is currently proposed to become the default
garbage collector in JDK 9. Recently three new ideas for G1 were
described on the hotspot-gc-dev at openjdk.java.net mailing list:
- parallel full GC
- throughput write barriers
- rebuilding remembered sets during concurrent mark&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will present these three new ideas so that people who are
interested in getting into G1 development know where to start, see what
the existing code looks like today and highlight how one can contribute
(it is not only about code!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation can be made longer if people want to dive deeper into
the details (but it can also fit in a 25 minute slot).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ruby's Strings aggregate a collection of bytes and an encoding, allowing
for IO to avoid transcoding, regular expressions to execute against raw
bytes, and 7-bit strings to be compactly represented. Only the last item
has been adopted by Java. To make matters worse, most Java APIs depend on
Java's string representation, making them incompatible with alternative
languages like Ruby. We'll explore the advantages of Ruby's string compared
to Java's and discuss options for improving Java's string support in the
future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;HotSpot's optimizing Just-In-Time compiler C2 is reaching its end-of-life and it's time to look for alternatives. One very promising replacement candidate is Graal. Graal is a Java JIT compiler written in Java. It is being developed by Oracle Labs for a couple years now and has reached a state where it's viable to be that replacement. Twitter's huge distributed system tickles every corner of the JVM and is the perfect testing ground for a new JIT compiler technology like Graal. This presentation will talk about Twitter's experiences with Graal, good and bad, the bugs we found and also the wins.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of years, the OpenJDK Quality Outreach effort
has become a good source of high quality feedback from many popular FOSS
projects starting with JDK 7 Updates, JDK 8 and JDK 8 Updates. It now
plays the same role for JDK 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  With a number of large changes being planned for JDK 9 that are
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;being developed through the OpenJDK community, reaching out to popular
FOSS projects well ahead of a release and keeping them informed of
upcoming changes, collecting as well as acting on their feedback created
a great feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Today, around 80 open source projects and communities participate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in testing of early access builds of the JDK, reporting issues they
find, and helping get them resolved in time. In this session, we'll look
at some examples of how they have helped make JDK 9 better, and discuss
how we can together improve the OpenJDK Quality Outreach effort for JDK 10.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;At Dropbox, with 1000s of machines running MySQL, performance is important. Among other things, out team is responsible for our MySQL servers being tuned well.
In this talk, we will talk about the performance impact of “environmental” MySQL tuning, where the tuning is neither at the SQL level (like creating indexes or using different table structures), nor with setting MySQL parameters (tuning parameters like innodb&lt;em&gt;buffer&lt;/em&gt;pool&lt;em&gt;size or innodb&lt;/em&gt;log&lt;em&gt;file&lt;/em&gt;size even more obscure ones like innodb&lt;em&gt;lru&lt;/em&gt;scan_depth). Instead, in the talk we will cover the following areas (we won’t limit the talk to these):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating system level tuning opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compiling MySQL: does it worth to build your own from the performance perspective?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building MySQL with different compilers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building MySQL with profile-guided optimization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact of using different memory allocators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU and memory affinity with running multiple instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The experiments we conducted here helped us to make more educated decisions about how to run MySQL at Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Applying profilers to MySQL</title>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While troubleshooting MySQL performance problems it is important to find out where CPU time is spent inside mysqld process. The process of investigation should have as small influence as possible on the server we try to troubleshoot. Ideally, the source code should be instrumented for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance_schema introduced in MySQL 5.5 is supposed to provide detailed enough instrumentation. But it comes with a cost, require careful sizing of performance counters, and the process of instrumenting the code is not yet complete even for MySQL itself, to say nothing about 3rd party storage engines, plugins and libraries like Galera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when profilers come handy. Poor Man's Profiler (PMP, aka pt-pmp), perf and oprofile on Linux can be easily used while studying MySQL performance problems. Basic usage steps are presented and several typical use cases are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In case of any performance problems with MySQL is important to find out where CPU time is spent inside mysqld process. Is it waiting on disk I/O, some lock or internal mutex, or maybe it performs complex computation that should be optimized? You can not figure out until you know how much time each important step takes, and how often it occurs. To investigate that, one may use different tools and approaches, from tracing the code to using simple OS level utilities that show disk and memory usage in total or per device, to more advanced programs that collect all kinds of information about specific program running (these are often called profilers). The process of investigation should have as small influence as possible on the server we try to troubleshoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the source code should be instrumented for that and provide a "domain-specific" performance metrics. It may be not enough to know how much time specific function runs if its code is huge and complex. Performance_schema introduced in MySQL 5.5 was supposed to provide detailed enough instrumentation. But it comes with a cost (performance penalty, that can be notable), require careful sizing of performance counters, force investigator to use advanced SQL to get the information needed. What's even worse, the process of instrumenting the code is not yet complete even for MySQL itself, to say nothing about 3rd party storage engines, plugins and libraries like Galera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when profilers come handy. During this talk we'll discuss the use of Poor Man's Profiler (PMP, aka pt-pmp), perf and oprofile on Linux to study MySQL performance problems. Basic usage steps are presented and several typical use cases are discussed. These including several famous bugs (like https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=68079), profiling for Galera, MyRocks storage engine etc. Quick review of the most interesting MySQL bug reports where profilers played a key role in the investigation is also presented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;You’ve deployed automation, enabled automatic master failover and tested it many times: great, you can now sleep at night without being paged by a failing server.  However, when you wake up in the morning, things might not have gone the way you expect.  This talk will be about such a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, a failure brought down a master.  Automation kicked in and fixed things.  However, a fancy failure, combined with human errors, with an edge-case recovery, and a lack of oversight in automation, lead to a split-brain.  This talk will go into details about the convoluted - but still real world - sequence of events that lead to this disaster.  I will cover what could have avoided the split-brain and what could have make things easier to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Most database attackers are after your sensitive data. But there's no easy way to detect them accessing the data since your application will be accessing it too. This is where honey-potting can be really useful. This session will demonstrate a neat way to do honey-potting using nothing but existing MySQL tools.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We will demonstrate how one can set up a "honey-pot table" and set alarms around it in such a way that, when the table is accessed the server will take decisive actions to limit the session's access and warn the DBA. We will do with nothing but stock tools available for the MySQL 5.7 server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As proxies (and database routers) go, the first one I ever used was the now deprecated MySQL Proxy. Since then, I've managed to use MariaDB MaxScale quite a bit (including its fork AirBnB MaxScale), played around with ProxySQL in recent time, and also started taking a look at MySQL Router. In this quick 20-minute overview, we'll discuss why these three exist, a feature comparison, and reasons when to use the right tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;DAMP:
Docker is the component that makes the whole environment portable (only bash and Docker needed to set it up)
Ansible is an agentless config management system that makes the whole setup automated and painless
ProxySQL is a rising star on MySQL's horizon giving full control to DBAs over queries before they hit the DBs.
MHA is an proven MySQL HA solution that's easily customizable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My aim with this demo/repo is to show people how easy to set up a test environment with to test a really good MySQL HA/Proxy solution.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Attendees will gain insight into how to leverage Ansible plays to automate many tasks for managing a highly available MySQL environment with the ability of read/write split, load balancing, on-the-fly query rewrite(ProxySQL).
We're going to demonstrate scenarios like:
- Building HA environment in 3 minutes
- ProxySQL auto dynamic config generation with Ansible
- failover without losing a single SELECT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fully working Ansible playbook will be available for the attendees running in Docker&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Speeding Up Analytical Queries in MariaDB</title>
        <subtitle>CTE's and Window Functions Highlight</subtitle>
        <track>MySQL and Friends</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Window functions are an important tool for analytical queries. Window functions act as regular functions but have access to more than one row during computation. This makes them highly useful for optimising queries involving self-joins, as well as queries that need to extract data from multiple related rows from the same table. The performance speedups obtained are sometimes 100 fold. This talk will explain how that is possible, as well as use cases for window functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, window functions pair well with another feature that MariaDB 10.2 has introduced - Common Table Expressions. This feature was contributed by a community member and helps make queries more maintainable and sometimes faster. This feature will be covered, mostly through the use of window functions, but also introduce new use cases, such as computing the transitive closure of a graph.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The agenda for the talk is:
* What are window functions
* Solving problems with regular SQL and window functions
   * Smoothing data
   * Finding islands
   * Computing median
   * Top-N Queries
* What are CTEs
* Where CTEs are useful
* Introduction into recursive CTEs
* Performance comparison&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Apache Spark is a cluster computing framework, similar to Apache Hadoop. There are a number of tasks where MySQL does not show great performance: for example MySQL is not massively parallel system and a single query will only utilize 1 CPU core . Spark, on the the other hand is designed to be massively parallel; in addition Spark is a clustering framework, so you can easily add more compute nodes so that Spark can utilize more resources and scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Drill is similar project aimed to make data discovery easier. For example it allow you to join data sources in MySQL, MongoDB, flat files, other RDBMS, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will demonstrate how to use Apache Spark together with MySQL for data analysis. I will sho how Apache Spark aggregates data (wikipedia pageview statistics) and stores the resultset in MySQL. I will also show how to use Apache Spark with multiple sources and join virtual tables from MySQL, flat files and even MongoDB.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MySQL Group Replication implements a "synchronous" replication protocol built
upon a Group Communication Framework which is responsible for disseminating
transactions to a set of MySQL instances and for managing their membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we are going to present the framework's key properties and also
detail the design decisions made to efficiently handle group replication demand
for a high throughput and low latency communication infrastructure. Moreover, we
are going to bring forth the main differences between our solution and mainstream
algorithms such as classic multi-paxos and raft.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MySQL Group Replication brings together group communication
techniques and database replication to build a resilient,
highly available database service. Fault-tolerance comes,
however, at the cost of complexity and extra work that the
system itself has to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, we will look at how Group Replication performs
and how it can meet the most demanding performance
requirements. We will also bring forth a few tips and guidelines
to configure and manage it in the most optimal way. These may
help you to set it up efficiently and meet your infrastructure
requirements. At the end of the session you will have learned
how to make the most out of the Group Replication plug-in in
terms of HA while achieving good performance overall.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Redundancy is the prominent technique for creating resilient, highly
available services. MySQL has had a quite mature and feature rich
replication solution for over a decade now. Moreover, there are
interesting new features that allow users to create quite advanced
setups. Nowadays, there is group replication, multi-source replication,
and of course plain asynchronous replication that allow users to
create interesting new setups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session we will present recommended ways to mix and match
group replication with regular asynchronous replication. We will
show how the user can combine both to create simple upgrade/migration
paths to complex setups. We will also show specifically on group
replication what is the recommended procedure to provision and deploy
replicas and detail what happens behind the scenes when a replica
joins the group.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Portability of containers across diverse HPC resources with Singularity</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Traditional container technology (i.e. Docker) was not meant for the deployment of HPC applications among large computing clusters. New container technology like Singularity focuses on the portability of compute, allowing us to ease deployment, reducing administrative overhead and user support. However, some issues still need special attention, for example how to handle different MPI configurations (e.g. over Infiniband), and how to handle special resources like GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, there is no need to have applications installed on any cluster or HPC/scientific resource; we can use container technology to encapsulate all the software and libraries of any specific application, ensuring the operation thereof in any possible operating system, software, and hardware architecture, avoiding  incompatibilities and retaining native or near-native performance. Our design strategy makes the container agnostic to the queue system i.e. the container works with SLURM, TORQUE and stand alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover creating such portable containers using multiple resources, and showing how simple is to deploy a complex MPI dependant application across multiple TOP500 supercomputer with only a regular user account, including the ability to exploit existing resources like Infiniband and GPGPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also we’ll show how to add open source profiling tools to the container. We are going to show execution profiling samples of critical HPC/ML applications like VASP, Amber, Seismic Imaging and Chainer running on portable containers across different HPC systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>How supercomputing is being made available to all Cuban researchers using FOSS</subtitle>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;To offer supercomputing services to all Cuban institutes of higher education, research centers and industrial partners is the mission set forth by a group of ambitious young system administrators working at various universities of the lush Caribbean island of Cuba. With the assistance of the Flemish Inter-university Council (VLIR), lots of hard work and hardware donations by Ghent University they have succeeded in setting up a nation-spanning architecture comprised of three datacenters, in Havana (West), Santa Clara (central) and Santiago de Cuba (East). Their campuses are spread geographically across the 1000 km long island and are interconnected by a 20 Mbps network that covers up to the furthest regions of the island where remote rural universities are given the opportunity to take advantage of the magnificent capacities of massive parallel processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus was born "HPC Cuba" the national center for academic supercomputing. While fully depending on Free Software for their operations, HPC Cuba has also joined the global Free Software community by producing installation packages for software not yet covered by EasyBuild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a tropical island where access to resources is being limited by a US imposed trade embargo, setting up a datacenter capable of hosting a proper supercomputer "no es fácil" ("it is not easy", a Cuban saying). Come learn about the specific challenges poised in the Cuban context, calling for resourceful solutions and unique problem-solving capacities standing proof of the high standard of the universities of this so-called third world country and its relentless human resources.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;HPC computing environment and especially super computing has its bag
of challenges when it comes to software deployment. As scientists we
often do not get root access which means that we either depend on what
software is available or we build software in a dedicated directory
using tools such as Brew, Conda or even from source. Unfortunately
these solutions depend on already installed tools from an underlying
distribution, often proprietary or dated compilers, and, for example,
modules. Any binary that gets produced, therefore, tends to be totally
unique, both in the generated binary and its set of dependencies. This
is bad, both for trouble shooting and for pursuing reproducible
science. With GNU Guix we are developing a fully reproducible free software
stack including all dependencies targeting cross-builds for
heterogeneous computing environments, such as the Beacon Intel
PHI-based supercomputer, without having a requirement for
containers. In this talk I will describe the challenges we are
overcoming and what it will mean for the HPC community to have
architecture optimized and fully reproducible build targets that can
be deployed in a non-root, non-container environment.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Enabling Reproducible Scientific Software Installation on Cray Supercomputers with EasyBuild</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;EasyBuild is a framework for building and installing (scientific) software on HPC clusters, implemented in Python and available under the GPLv2 FOSS license. It has served HPC support teams well on standard Linux/x86 systems since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, interest has grown to also employ EasyBuild on Cray systems, where the Cray Programming Environment (PE) not only provides common tools (compilers, ...) and libraries (MPI, BLAS/LAPACK, FFTW, ...), but also tuned installations of 3rd party libraries like HDF5, netCDF and PETSc. The Cray PE consists of an extensive stack of environment modules, providing a familiar yet complex working environment of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To leverage the Cray PE a couple of enhancements had to be made to EasyBuild, including support for using 'external' modules, and defining Cray-specific compiler toolchains. In addition, the way in which EasyBuild deals with environment modules had to be carefully revisited, since standard operations like 'module purge' are not supported by the Cray PE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work has led to the use of EasyBuild in production on the largest Cray supercomputer in Europe, the Piz Daint system at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will outline how Cray systems are different from standard HPC systems, motivate the need for a tool like EasyBuild despite the presence of Cray PE, and show how EasyBuild was tweaked to support reproducible software installations on Cray systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe this is interesting success story of how FOSS has significantly enhanced the software environment on a multi-million dollar production system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Putting Your Jobs Under the Microscope using OGRT</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With the advent of modern package managers for scientific applications (EasyBuild, Spack, etc.) automated building of large amounts of software is becoming easier, quickly giving rise to issues related to life cycle management of applications. This makes tracking the applications and libraries that actually get used considerably more important. Existing solutions (module load hooks, launch wrappers) do not account for user-built software, are hard to deploy or produce inconclusive results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OGRT enables the tracking of jobs on a cluster with process-level granularity and without discernible performance penalty. It tracks used shared libraries, environment variables and loaded modules at the moment of process execution. It also supports watermarking executables and shared objects and reading those watermarks out of memory at runtime. Gathered information is collected and shipped to various backends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OGRT aims to be a versatile tool, which can be used to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide a census of used software (including user-built)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;troubleshoot problems with programs picking up unexpected shared libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;retroactively inform users about buggy libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overlay process-level data onto existing job monitoring tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contribute to reproducibility of application runs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This presentation will give an overview of the design and implementation of OGRT, as well as demoing some of its capabilities when plugged into an Elasticsearch backend.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The growing Python data science ecosystem, including the foundational packages Numpy and Pandas, provides powerful tools for data analysis that are widely used in a variety of applications. Typically, these libraries were designed for data that fits in memory and for computations that run on a single core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dask is a Python library for parallel and distributed computing, using blocked algorithms and task scheduling. By leveraging the existing Python data ecosystem, Dask enables to compute on arrays and dataframes that are larger than memory, while exploiting parallelism or distributed computing power, but in a familiar interface (mirroring Numpy arrays and Pandas dataframes).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Purely Functional GPU Programming with Futhark</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>HPC, Big Data and Data Science</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We present the pure functional array language, Futhark, along with its optimising GPU-targeting compiler.  Of particular focus are the language tradeoffs necessary to ensure the ability to efficiently generate high-performance GPU code from a high-level parallel language.  We also demonstrate (nested) data-parallel array programming, a programming paradigm that enables concise programming of massively parallel systems.  We show how Futhark code can be easily integrated with larger applications written in other language.  Finally, we report benchmarks showing that Futhark is able to match the performance of hand-written code on various published benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;GPUs and other massively parallel systems are now common, yet
programming them is often a painful experience.  Languages are often
low-level and fragile, with careful hand-optimisation necessary to
obtain good performance.  The programmer is often forced to write
highly coupled code with little modularity.  The high-level languages
that exist, often functional in nature, are often insufficiently
flexible, or poor performes in practice.  We present our work on a
programming language that seeks a common ground between imperative and
functional approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futhark is a small programming language designed to be compiled to
efficient GPU code.  It is a statically typed, data-parallel, and
purely functional array language, and comes with a heavily optimising
ahead-of-time compiler that generates GPU code via OpenCL.  Futhark is
not designed for graphics programming, but instead uses the compute
power of the GPU to accelerate data-parallel array computations.  We
support regular nested data-parallelism, as well as a form of
imperative-style in-place modification of arrays, while still
preserving the purity of the language via the use of a uniqueness type
system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Futhark language and compiler is an ongoing research project.  It
can compile nontrivial programs which then run on real GPUs at high
speed.  The Futhark compiler employs a set of optimisations (fusion,
flattening, distribution, tiling, etc) to shield the programmer from
having to know the details of the underlying hardware.  The Futhark
language itself is still very spartan - due to the basic design
criteria requiring the ability to generate high-performance GPU code,
it takes more effort to support language features that are common in
languages with more forgiving compilation targets.  Nevertheless,
Futhark can already be used for nontrivial programs, and has been used
to port several real-world benchmark applications, with performance
comparable to original hand-written GPU (OpenCL or CUDA) code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futhark is not intended to replace existing general-purpose languages.
Our intended use case is that Futhark is only used for relatively
small but compute-intensive parts of an application.  The Futhark
compiler generates code that can be easily integrated with non-Futhark
code.  For example, you can compile a Futhark program to a Python
module that internally uses PyOpenCL to execute code on the GPU, yet
looks like an ordinary Python module from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Experiences of supporting HPC/HTC workloads on private cloud resources, with ideas for how to do this better and description of trends for non-traditional HPC resource provision.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I will discuss my work as part of the Operations Team for the eMedLab private cloud, https://www.emedlab.ac.uk, which is a large-scale (6000-core, 5PB) biomedical research cloud using HPC hardware, aiming to support HPC workloads. This includes an account of the technical challenges of marrying traditional HPC components such as parallel filesystems with the rather different expectations of the OpenStack cloud management framework. Other challenges faced include educating users about the basics of virtual environments, providing access to restricted-license large-scale (800TB) datasets in a multi-tenant environment, and achieving good performance inside virtual HPC clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking to the future, container orchestration engines such as Kubernetes provide a very promising approach, as the containerisation of scientific applications gains momentum, and I will describe existing and future work in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This talk looks at how the pipeline API works as well as how to add your own custom algorithms to Apache Spark. The talk will be focused in Scala, but the same techniques can be used in Java or with other JVM languages. Sadly extending the pipeline API can not currently be done in non-JVM languages, but the information on how to use the pipeline API will be useful to Python and R users as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;BigBench is the brand new standard (TPCx-BB) for benchmarking and testing Big Data systems. The BigBench specification describes several application use cases combining the need for SQL queries, Map/Reduce, user code (UDF), Machine Learning, and even streaming. From the available implementation, we can test the different framework combinations such as Hadoop+Hive (with Mahout) and Spark (SparkSQL+SparkML) in their different versions and configurations, helping us to spot problems and possible optimizations of our data stacks.&lt;br/&gt;
This talk first introduces BigBench and how problems can it solve. Then, presents both Hive and Spark benchmark results with with their respective 1 and 2 versions under different configurations including: Tez, LLAP, and file formats.  Experiments are run on Cloud and On-Prem clusters of different numbers of nodes and testing data scales from 1GB to 10TB, taking into account interactive and batch usage.  Results are further classified by use cases, showing where each platform shines (or doesn't), and why, based on performance metrics and log-file analysis. The talk concludes with the main findings, the scalability and limits of each framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I have been involved with Fedora Community Operations Team where I mostly contribute on community-metrics related tasks. This talk will be about a NLP-based tool I have built for Fedora wiki to make wiki-gardening tasks easier for contributors, the methods I used for building it and how it can be scaled to any other wiki.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fedora wiki is a community documentation space about different projects, initiatives, contributors in Fedora Project. However, due to large size of the project, the Fedora wiki has been growing in size and has become difficult to manage. As a result, wiki gardening tasks were born. These tasks generally involve not only updating current information on wiki pages but also identifying pages with redundant information to merge them, marking pages with old and outdated information accordingly etc.Most of these wiki gardening tasks are a part of one-day FADs, hackathons or sprints and suitable for new contributors looking to contribute to the project as they have a low entry-barrier. While there has been a category traditionally to mark wiki pages which need to be worked on, this task is mostly manual(needs to be done by some contributor prior to the hackathon or event) and also doesn't cover the whole wiki as it is manually difficult due to it's large size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My tool uses Natural Language Processing-based techniques to
1.Identify pages with redundant information so that contributors can merge/delete them
2.Identify pages in a specific category/topic which need to be worked on.
3.Identify old pages which might need to be updated or categorized as out-of-date&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the tool faster, I have used Parallel Processing techniques. In this talk, I would like to describe the tool and it's functionality, the methods I used for building it and how it can be scaled to any other wiki. I would also like to hear feedback on other wiki gardening tasks this tool could possibly be used for, and how to scale it to automatically merge pages with redundant information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As machine learning (ML) finds its way into more and more areas in our life, software developers from all fields are asked to navigate an increasingly complex maze of tools and algorithms to extract value out of massive datasets. In this talk we'll try to help the aspiring ML developer by describing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a conceptual framework that most ML algorithms fall under&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a concise overview of the most popular open-source ML software platforms aimed at big data problems, including Tensorflow, Spark ML, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some common mistakes and misconceptions in the development and deployment of ML systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The goal of the talk is to aid the audience to think about ML problems in an integrated manner;
facilitating the process of going from problem to prototype, making an informed choice about the tools and software to use, and providing a list of considerations about problems that can, and do come up in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk is designed to be informative and entertaining, with little previous knowledge required.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Apache NiFi provided a revolutionary data flow management system with a broad range of integrations with existing data production, consumption, and analysis ecosystems, all covered with robust data delivery and provenance infrastructure. Now learn about the follow-on project which expands the reach of NiFi to the edge, Apache MiNiFi. MiNiFi is a lightweight application which can be deployed on hardware orders of magnitude smaller and less powerful than the existing standard data collection platforms. With both a JVM compatible and native agent, MiNiFi allows data collection in brand new environments — sensors with tiny footprints, distributed systems with intermittent or restricted bandwidth, and even disposable or ephemeral hardware. Not only can this data be prioritized and have some initial analysis performed at the edge, it can be encrypted and secured immediately. Local governance and regulatory policies can be applied across geopolitical boundaries to conform with legal requirements. And all of this configuration can be done from central command &amp;amp; control using an existing NiFi with the trusted and stable UI data flow managers already love.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Hadoop has been touted as a replacement for data warehouses.  In practice Hadoop has had success offloading ETL/ELT workloads, but still has gaps serving requirements for operational analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Bigtop now includes Greenplum Database in deployment of big data solutions. Greenplum Database is, an open source massively parallel data warehouse  based on PostgreSQL, and is an excellent addition to the Hadoop ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this session we'll cover:
 * Introduction to Greenplum
 * Bigtop Support for Greenplum
 * External tables in Hadoop by Greenplum
 * Parallel reads and writes to Hadoop by Greenplum
 * Running advanced analytics on structured and unstructured data in both Hadoop and Greenplum via Apache MADlib (incubating)
 * Geospatial and Machine Learning in Greenplum based on HDFS data
 * Storing data from a data lake in Greenplum for high throughput analytical queries&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Implementing use cases on unified data platforms. Having a unified data processing engine empowers Big Data application developers as it makes connections between seemingly unrelated use cases natural. This talk discusses the implementation of the so-called BigPetStore project (which is a part of Apache Bigtop) in Apache Spark and Apache Flink. The aim BigPetStore is to provide a common suite to test and benchmark Big Data installations. The talk features best practices and implementation with the batch, streaming, SQL, DataFrames and machine learning APIs of Apache Spark and Apache Flink side by side. A range of use cases are outlined in both systems from data generation, through ETL, recommender systems to online prediction.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Democratizing Deep Learning with Tensorflow on Hops Hadoop</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;According to Andrej Kaparthy, there are four main factors holding back AI: Compute, Data, Algorithms, and Infrastructure. In this talk, we will show how we attack the Data and Infrastructure challenges for Deep Learning. Specifically, we will show how we integrated Tensorflow with the world's most scalable and human-friendly distribution of Hadoop, Hops (www.hops.io). Hops is a new European distribution of Hadoop with a distributed metadata architecture and 16X the performance of HDFS. Hops also includes a human-friendly UI, called Hopsworks, with support for the Apache Zeppelin Notebook. We will show how users can run tensorflow programs in Apache Zeppelin on huge datasets in Hadoop. Moreover, we will show how Hopsworks makes discovering and downloading huge datasets a piece of cake with peer-to-peer sharing of datasets between Hopsworks clusters. Within minutes, you can install Hopsworks, discover curated important datasets and download them to train Deep Neural networks using Tensorflow. Hops is the first Hadoop distribution to support Tensorflow.
Hops and Hopsworks are both Apache v2 licensed projects and have been developed primarily at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and SICS Swedish ICT in Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

A new user can, within minutes, install Hopsworks, discover curated important datasets and download them to train Deep Neural networks using Tensorflow. Hops is the first Hadoop distribution to support Tensorflow.
Hopsworks itself is a self-service UI for Hops Hadoop, that is based around projects, users, and dataset concepts. Users collaborate in projects that contain datasets. Data owners can give users access to process data (but not download it, copy it outside of the project, or cross-link it with data outside the project). Hopsworks, thus, provides stronger access control guarantees than are available in Hadoop, enabling senstive data to securely reside on shared Hadoop clusters. Since April 2016, Hopsworks has provided Hadoop/Spark/Flink/Kafka-as-a-service to researchers in Sweden from the Swedish ICT SICS Data Center at www.hops.site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hops and Hopsworks are both Apache v2 licensed projects and have been developed primarily at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and SICS Swedish ICT in Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;trivago is processing roughly 7 billion events per day with an architecture that is entirely open source - from producing the data until its visualization in dashboards and reports. This talk will explain the idea behind the pipeline and share the experience and engineering challenges from two years in production.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I will  show the different tools, frameworks and systems used, with Kafka and Kafka Streams the main focus. The successful implementation of this large scale data processing pipeline fundamentally transformed the way trivago was able to approach its business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle/>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Large-scale data stream processing has come a long way to where it is today. It combines all the essential requirements of modern data analytics: subsecond latency, high throughput and impressively, strong consistency. Apache Flink is a system that serves as a proof-of-concept of these characteristics and it is mainly well-known for its lightweight fault tolerance. Data engineers and analysts can now let the system handle Terabytes of computational state without worrying about failures that can potentially occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I am going to explain all the fundamental challenges behind exactly-once processing guarantees in large-scale streaming in a simple and intuitive way. I will further guide you through the tricks and pitfalls that we faced in our effort to make state management easy to use, transparent and yet extraordinarily powerful. Finally, I will demonstrate how you can declare state and the in-flight protocol that is running underneath your processing pipeline to guarantee that your computation will always run consistently and uninterrupted, until infinity.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In more detail I am going to demonstrate the basic and extended versions of ABS (Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting) , our state-of-the-art decentralized, in-flight snapshotting algorithm tailored to the needs of a dataflow graph. ABS needs no global synchronisation and works purely in a decentralised manner. It is considered today as one of the most lightweight mechanisms for checkpointing application state and has been developed even further together with the rest  of the Flink community with additional optimisations. In fact, other open source systems such as Apache Storm  have also recently incorporated the same mechanism due to its simplicity and effectiveness. One of such optimisations that is currently being merged in the system, is the adaptation of the algorithm in graphs that contain cycles which I am also going to cover in this talk in more detail. Furthermore, I will also briefly explain our current efforts to incrementalize state snapshots to further balance the load trade-off of state checkpointing and recovery time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;When working with BigData &amp;amp; IoT systems we often feel the need for a Common Query Language. The platform specific languages are often  harder to integrate with and require longer adoption time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fill this gap many NoSql (Not-only-Sql) vendors are building SQL layers for their platforms. It is worth exploring the driving forces behind this trend, how it fits in your BigData stacks and how we can adopt it in our favorite tools.
However building SQL engine from scratch is a daunting job and frameworks like Apache Calcite can help you with the heavy lifting. Calcite allow you to integrate SQL parser, cost-based optimizer, and JDBC with your big data system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calcite has been used to empower many Big-Data platforms such as Hive, Spark, Drill Phoenix to name some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will walk you through the process of building a SQL access layer for Apache Geode (In-Memory Data Grid). I will share my experience, pitfalls and technical consideration like balancing between the SQL/RDBMS semantics and the design choices and limitations of the data system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this will enable you to add SQL capabilities to your prefered NoSQL data system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;An introduction to graph databases.
From graph theory, through the history of computing and how it affected database design, to why relational databases aren't about relations.
Next, a look how diverse is the current graph database market and what obvious and not so obvious problems are solved by graphs.
A short introduction to Neo4j's query language, Cypher, will show the main concepts of querying graph data.  Then, by use of the same datasets in both relational and graph databases will compare syntax clarity and database performance.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Using graph databases in popular open source CMSs</title>
        <subtitle>Neo4J and Drupal, potential application areas and module introduction</subtitle>
        <track>Graph</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally CMSs use SQL databases that are really fast when you need all the information stored together in a record row, but are a bad fit when you need to search for relationship patterns that are not already stored together in your database. A significant performance penalty is incurred for every additional table that needs to be joined for a query. That is why SQL databases are notoriously bad at deducting relationships from datasets. Graph databases however are really good at this task. In this talk we discuss potential application areas of graph databases in existing open source CMSs like Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We believe graph databases could make a big difference when used in key areas where traditionally CMSs would fail:
Explore large non-uniform datasets: Neo4j got a lot of attention after it was used by investigative journalists to &lt;a href="https://neo4j.com/blog/analyzing-panama-papers-neo4j/"&gt;identify the organisations and individuals involved in offshore tax evasion in the Panama papers leak&lt;/a&gt;.
Recommend content: Media companies like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k47aC01Uy64&amp;amp;ab_channel=Neo4j-theWorld%27sLeadingGraphDatabase"&gt;the Financial Times are using Neo4j to display related content&lt;/a&gt; on their website, this helps them to increase engagement with higher clickthrough rates.
Personalisation: &lt;a href="https://neo4j.com/news/adidas-neo4j-customer-experience/"&gt;Addidas uses the Neo4j graph database to create it’s internal metadata service&lt;/a&gt;, offering access and searchability to their data and making sense of complex interdependencies and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've created a basic integration that makes it possible for non-developers to work with Neo4j. Combined with Drupal’s content modelling capabilities we believe it could be a powerful tool for people to explore graph databases using a GUI. There is also a case to be made for the use of graph databases in the Drupal ecosystem: sites that already use Drupal could benefit from its capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How can we evaluate a global query on huge graphs in 0.1 seconds? Given our current technology, that would be magic. The lack of wizarding skills did not stop us, however, from tackling the problem by using smart caching structures, which are witchcrafts on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this challenge important? Several applications evaluate global queries on continuously changing graphs: &lt;a href="https://neo4j.com/resources/recommendations-business-white-paper/"&gt;fraud detection in financial transactions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://docs.inf.mit.bme.hu/ingraph/pub/stein-daniel-static-analysis.pdf"&gt;analysis of source code repositories&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-11653-2_40"&gt;validating engineering models&lt;/a&gt;. Current approaches employ domain-specific optimizations, which are difficult and error-prone to implement. Meanwhile, the requirements of these (and similar) use cases could be uniformly addressed by incremental graph query evaluation. With this technique, the first execution of the queries takes some time, but once the result are calculated, they can be efficiently maintained for each change in the graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To allow incremental queries on property graphs, we implemented the &lt;a href="https://github.com/FTSRG/ingraph"&gt;ingraph&lt;/a&gt; engine, based on the &lt;a href="http://www.opencypher.org/"&gt;openCypher&lt;/a&gt; language specification. We aim to support the &lt;a href="https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/blob/master/docs/standardisation-scope.adoc"&gt;standard subset&lt;/a&gt; of openCypher, as most standard constructs can be calculated incrementally. We already mapped some of the standard constructs to &lt;a href="http://docs.inf.mit.bme.hu/ingraph/pub/opencypher-report.pdf"&gt;relational algebra&lt;/a&gt;, defined &lt;a href="http://docs.inf.mit.bme.hu/preprints/perpol2016-gqo.pdf"&gt;incremental relational algebraic operators&lt;/a&gt; and implemented them in an &lt;a href="https://github.com/FTSRG/ire"&gt;incremental relational engine&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="http://akka.io/"&gt;Akka&lt;/a&gt; actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start the talk by presenting use cases that evaluate complex global queries on continuously changing graphs and discuss the idea of incremental graph queries. We show the mapping of basic openCypher constructs (e.g. &lt;code&gt;MATCH&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WITH&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RETURN&lt;/code&gt;) to relational operators, such as joins, selections and projections. Finally, we show our approach for optimizing incremental graph queries and outline related challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audience: Developers, looking for a deeper understanding of openCypher and/or facing complex queries on continuously changing graphs&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Presentation of the original vision of the Twitter Stream Importer, from start to current situation with "experience feedback". If possible showing a demo real-time and "open discussion" about improvement on going, visualisation usage etc...&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since some years now, the particularity of Twitter is to be "reactive" or real time compare to other Social Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The massive stream of data generated by some events (going from Tv shows to more serious event) can't be digested with traditional tools (Twittdeck etc...).
The visual representation of a twitter activity could help to reveal insights on a running topic. Graph allows to contextualize and visualise the interaction between users and thematic within this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that, the Twitter Stream Importer brings tools to start tracking a topic and visualise data with different "Network logic" that act like a particular projection of the data. The integration within Gephi then, makes easy to use the integrated tools (statistics, filter, exports) to works easily on you subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will see what are the main concept, what are the pro and cons and the following evolution of the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Graph pattern matching is one of the most interesting and challenging operations in graph analytics. However, it is primarily supported by graph database systems such as Neo4j but, besides research prototypes, not generally available for distributed (not-only graph) processing frameworks like Apache Flink or Apache Spark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our talk, we want to give an overview of our current implementation of Cypher on Apache Flink. Cypher is the Neo4j graph query language and enables the intuitive definition of graph patterns including structural and semantic predicates. As the Neo4j graph data model is not supported out-of-the box by Apache Flink, we leverage Gradoop, a Flink-based graph analytics framework based on Apache Flink that already provides an abstraction of schema-free property graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will give a brief overview about the technologies used to implement Cypher, explain our query engine and give a demonstration of the available language features. Finally, we will discuss open challenges and missing features hopefully motivating people to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is a cooperation between the University of Leipzig and Neo Technology.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Additional speaker: Max Kießling (M.Sc. student @Neo Technology)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intended audience and goal of the talk: Developers and analysts, trying to express graph queries on distributed graphs&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Mining frequent itemsets is an established approach to data mining and supported by productive data mining solutions. For example, one can get insights about buyers’ behavior by analyzing frequent co-occurrences of products in shopping baskets. In contrast, frequent subgraph mining (FSM), the graphy variant of frequent itemset mining, not only evaluates entity co-occurrence but also relationships among entities, i.e., structural patterns. However, existing implementations are all research prototypes which are tailored to textbook problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our talk, we want to give an introduction to the FSM problem on distributed collections of graphs and our implementation in Gradoop, an open source system for scalable graph analytics based on Apache Flink. In contrast to other iterative graph algorithms like page rank, in FSM the search space is dropped but intermediate results of iterations are the desired result. Here, the major technical challenge is the respective usage of Flinks’ distributed iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will explain different implementation approaches, discuss implementation details which influence scalability and show benchmark results.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Designing a graph library for JavaScript</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Graph</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While a lot of languages already have comprehensive libraries to handle graph data (like &lt;a href="http://networkx.github.io/"&gt;networkx&lt;/a&gt; in python), the same cannot be said for JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk discusses how we were driven to create a multipurpose graph object specification for JavaScript and what were the design issues we soon had to tackle from implementation choices to API naming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of this work is the &lt;a href="https://graphology.github.io/"&gt;graphology&lt;/a&gt; specification &amp;amp; reference implementation which we present to open it to feedbacks &amp;amp; contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will first review the state of the art of graph libraries for JavaScript and discuss the issues which brought us to create a new projet from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we will explain why we chose to design an open specification for a standard API rather than only providing a library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we will present the reference implementation &amp;amp; the attached library of algorithms and justify the technical choices made, before presenting our future roadmap and related projects (a new version of the graph rendering library, &lt;a href="http://sigmajs.org/"&gt;sigma.js&lt;/a&gt;, notably).&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With the recent announcement of the SAP HANA express edition, a free to use and streamlined version of SAP HANA that can run on laptops and other resource-constrained hosts, it is now possible to use the SAP HANA Graph functionality for free in own graph projects and applications with up to 32GB main memory limit. In addition, the SAP HANA express edition offers  development utilities that can be used to develop own applications on top of SAP HANA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we will provide an overview of SAP HANA Graph, a native graph processing engine, which is tightly integrated into the database kernel of SAP HANA. It allows to freely combine graph, relational, text, and geospatial processing on a single transactional data representation without the need to replicate data into specialized systems. In particular, we will use the SAP HANA express edition running on the speaker's laptop to demonstrate the audience a walk-through of the steps to get started with SAP HANA Graph. Specifically, we will show how to execute Cypher queries in SAP HANA and also showcase GraphScript, a high-level domain-specific graph query language for imperative and complex graph query processing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As graph processing moves to the mainstream, a large number of specialized graph engines have emerged.   However, for many enterprises, much of their important data resides in relational databases and SQL is the most common workload.  So is it reasonable to suggest that relational data processing engines can be used to solve graph problems in a productive and performant manner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this question is:  “Yes!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will address the use of massively parallel processing (MPP) databases for graph analytics workloads.  We will share some recent findings from the Apache MADlib (incubating) project, including design of graph data structures, implementation of common graph algorithms,  and performance results.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Graph analytics is becoming an important part of enterprise computing.  With roots in academia going back many decades, the last 10-15 years have seen a huge surge of interest in this topic to address a wide range of modern use cases, from cybersecurity to social networks to supply distribution chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enterprises have made significant investments in infrastructure, software, and training of their employees, all centered around SQL.  So how can an enterprise add graph analytics to their business without the cost and complexity of moving to specialized graph processing engines?  And, what are the tradeoffs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graph analytics is a new area of innovation in Apache MADlib, which is a SQL-based open source library for scalable in-database analytics.  It provides parallel implementations of mathematical, statistical and machine learning methods for structured and unstructured data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many existing analytics products do not scale in a way that makes it convenient and economical to operate on large data sets.  The graph methods in Apache MADlib have been designed to take advantage of the shared-nothing, scale-out parallelism offered by modern parallel database engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to presenting this topic at FOSDEM 17!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the era of docker, big data and micro services it is really important to distribute your applications reasonable across your cluster and keep a good overview of all of your applications. This fact is well addressed, but it would be great to utilize your cluster in that way, that you locate your data in the same cluster like the rest of your application landscape and share your physical resources all over your running applications, no matter if you are serving user requests, crunching data or calculating big graphs. For this reason we brought the awesome graph database Neo4j to run natively on top of Apache Mesos and DC/OS.
In this session we will see how easy it is to install, run, operate and scale out Neo4j Causal Clusters on top of Apache Mesos and DC/OS and which possibilities you have spanning big graphs across your cluster.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is a broad topic and many commercial products are related to it. We demonstrate a fundamental concept in network analysis: re-construction and visualization of temporal networks. Furthermore, we apply the method to describe operational conditions of a Hadoop cluster. Our experiments provide first results and allow a classification of the cluster state related to current workloads. The temporal networks show significant differences for different operation modes. In reallity we would expect mixed workloads. If such workload parameters are known, we are able to handle a-typical events accordingly - which means, we are able to create alerts based on context information, rather than only the package content.
We show an end-to-end example: (1) Data collection is done via python, using the sniffer script; (2) using Apache Hive and Apache Spark we analyze the network traffic data and create the temporary network. Finally, we are able to visualize the results using Gephi in step (3). In a next step, we plan to contribute to the Apache Spot project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is hosting a pre-FOSDEM hackfest on unintentional emitters of electromagnetic signals. The hackfest should attract many people from the software defined radio (SDR) community to participate as it will involve the design and development of techniques to discover, capture, identify, and disseminate the emissions and emitters. The hackfest will take place in Brussels from February 1 – 3, so this talk will provide a review of the work that went on in the days just preceding FOSDEM.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Electromagnetic (EM) emissions are everywhere and come from radio systems that purposefully emit EM signals, unintended emissions from these radios in other frequencies, and unintentional emissions from all of our electronics, even those not designed as radios. These emissions affect spectrum usage, which is a vital part of our daily lives and continues to grow in its importance. As more services and devices are depending on wireless connectivity, the problems of interference will grow, too. We typically think about interference coming from other wireless devices, but other electronics create EM emissions as well, such as computers and vehicles. But even more mundane electronics, like AC-to-DC converter “wall-warts” for charging cell phones, produce emissions. Though often low-power, the growing prevalence of electronics to support our daily lives is also an additive source of interference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DARPA will be hosting a hackfest in Brussels over the three days leading up to FOSDEM. The purpose of the hackfest on unintentional emitters is to help us develop techniques to find and study the emissions with the hope of better understanding and characterizing how different devices behave. The hackfest outcomes could lead to important scientific and technical knowledge for how we understand the interference problems from these emitters. Can we characterize how a building and its various components look by its EM emissions? How about parts of a city and the effects of traffic, subways, and other infrastructure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FOSDEM presentation will review the work that went on during the three-day hackfest and report on any resulting techniques/technology and what we learned about the unintentional emissions around us. It will be a relatively short talk presented without slides as a quick wrap-up to the FOSDEM SDR audience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There's no reason SDR needs to be limited to an elite group of users. There are so many tools out there that allow anyone with some technical background to quickly get familiar with the world of SDR. Depending on your background (Ham radio operator, software developer, wireless researcher, Michelin star chef) you may already know some parts of the big picture, but might be missing others.
The last few years, many tools have been created to ease your entry into SDR, and we will give an overview of what they are and how you can quickly get started working with electromagnetic waves.
No prior knowledge required!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Assuming you can operate a Linux computer, we will use the following tools to get you started with SDR and GNU Radio:
- PyBOMBS
- GNU Radio Companion
- gr_modtool&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The state of SDR, and free/open SDR in particular, is interesting. In some cases, SDR research and progress has been declared dead, implying that there is nothing left to research or develop. Practical usage of SDR tells a different story, though, and users of SDR products run into all sorts of issues every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this panel, we would like to discuss with the audience what the top issues are that SDR frameworks need to solve in the near future -- be they technical, legal, political or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What are the top 3 items that the realm of Software Defined Radio needs to figure out? In this panel, we invite some experts as well as the entire audience to discuss this question. We shall discuss technical challenges (if there are any) as well as legal and political challenges. Does free/open software radio have any different questions to tackle? If we were to attend a technical conference in the near future, what would be the most mind-blowing thing we could present? Will there be more, competing frameworks going forward, or will they consolidate? These and many more questions shall be the topic of this year's SDR panel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;JESD204B is a industry standard for interfacing high-speed converters (ADC, DAC) to logic devices (FPGA, ASIC). This presentation will give a introduction to the JESD204B standard which is gaining increasing adoption in SDR solutions to connect the RF-fronted device to the processing device.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;JESD204B is a industry standard for interfacing high-speed converters (ADC, DAC) to logic devices (FPGA, ASIC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software-defined-radio solutions follow a trend of ever increasing channel bandwidth and diversity (e.g. MIMO). Another trend is the transition from zero-IF to direct-IF, which bypasses the analog modulator and samples the full spectrum up to the desired signal. Both of them require additional data throughput rates which can reach the limits of more traditional interfaces like CMOS or LVDS. The JESD204B standard has been designed to overcome these restrictions and allow higher throughput data rates between the converter and the logic device. It is as such not surprising that to accommodate the increased data rate demands of such solutions JESD204B is often adopted, both for discrete as well as integrated RF designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to specifying the physical layer the JESD204B specification also has a protocol layer defining data mapping and encoding as well as standard methods for commonly needed features like data integrity checks, multi-chip synchronization and deterministic latency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will provide an introduction to the JESD204B standard in the context of software-defined-radio explaining how the different layers inside the JESD204B standard interact, giving developers a understanding of how to setup and configure a JESD204B system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Most SDR hardware nowadays includes an FPGA of sorts, but how to make use of them in an SDR application is often unclear for newcomers to the SDR ecosystem. Even more daunting can be to take first steps into FPGA-land and start writing code for your reprogrammable chips. We will talk about how an FPGA is actually useful for SDRs on an very basic level, and provide a very basic introduction into how to use the RFNoC framework to start using (and maybe learning) FPGAs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The following topics will be covered:
- How are FPGAs already available in modern SDR hardware?
- Which tasks are FPGAs well suited to tackle?
- When do we move tasks to an FPGA, and when do we not?
- How can we enter the realm of FPGA development using the RFNoC framework?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>GPU-Enabled Polyphase Filterbanks</title>
        <subtitle>Everyday I'm Shuffling</subtitle>
        <track>Software Defined Radio</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)  schemes are widely used in many existing communication systems and standards. On Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms, separating the channels can prove more difficult though due to high requirements for the digital filters. This talk will showcase an implementation of a polyphase filterbank on a graphics processor unit (GPU) that can help overcome the heavy computational load of those filters. In the software, all the partitioned filters can run in parallel. Each of these filters produces output samples for numerous input samples simultaneously, thus providing an additional parallel approach. Furthermore, several rational oversampling factors are supported by this implementation. Operations for oversampling can as well be implemented to run in parallel, due to the massive amount of usable hardware threads in a GPU. Hence, the effects of oversampling on the throughput can be reduced. On an Nvidia GTX970 GPU, this implementation achieved a throughput of 67.43 MSamples per second, 12 times higher than the (optimized) general purpose processor (GPP) version.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Separating information using the frequency space is rather simple if one can do it with appropriate hardware. Cycle accurate operations executed in FPGA and ASIC fabric allows one to carefully create the desired waveform and then control filterbanks and oscillators. This way, the desired information can get into the air at the exact time and frequency one fancies. Unfortunately, controlling a software defined radio (SDR) in that manner can prove to be quite a challenge. Timing constraints when changing the center frequency often turn out to be the main limiting factor [1]. Instead, a pure SDR approach is often the desired way of generating multifrequency content. To cope with hard latency/timing constraints, the solution is to generate the whole spectrum at once and to position the desired information digitally into the time/frequency matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this poses quite a challenge as one usually, depending on the number of channels, has to tremendously oversample the signal to generate the aggregated bandwidth. The needed anti-imaging filter at the transmitter side and the separation/anti-aliasing filters on the receiver side can grow to obscene amounts of filter taps.
Coping with this amount of computational load can be demanding, even for high-end general purpose processors (GPP). Using a polyphase filterbank (PFB) to do the synthesis/separation of the waveform can help eminently with reducing the computational load. PFBs do this by breaking down the needed filter in several polyphase partitions and doing the filtering on these partitions. A division of a filter in M polyphase partitions can already reduce the theoretical computational load by exactly a factor of M [2]. Additionally, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) can be used to extract or generate all channels needed at once, using just one filtering operation.Still, the challenge of separating the channels can prove to be too much for the GPP, even with the help of a PFB channelizer/synthesizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a graphics processor unit (GPU) can help immensely with offloading the critical task of separating the dedicated channels, providing some headroom for the GPP to perform the remaining task of decoding the information imprinted on the individual channels. Filtering itself is an operation that can be mapped pretty well onto many-core architectures, especially if the constraints on latency and buffer sizes are not as stringent.
But the operations inside a PFB really seem to be made for over the top parallelization. The notion of performing several independent polyphase partitioned filtering operations at once is something that can be easily mapped onto common GPU architecture abstractions, as every polyphase filter partition can run simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most GPUs have even more computing capabilities and their resources would lie idle if one only parallelized the PFB algorithm in terms of polyphase partitions.
Additionally, the computation of consecutive output samples is independent from each other. So one can further parallelize the algorithm by computing several output samples concurrently.
If the need for oversampling of the signal arises, that too can be exploited to produce the additional output samples in parallel, thereby minimizing the additional computational stress caused by oversampling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will showcase, how all operations of the algorithm of the PFB channelizer/synthesizer can be mapped to a GPU using the CUDA framework. Examples of the code will be shown to highlight some of the oddities one can encounter when developing code for GPUs or many-core architectures in general. Benchmarks and results of the current implementation will be presented and discussed. As of now, on an Nvidia GTX970, the implementation reaches a throughput of 67.43 MSamples per second (45 channels, 5x oversampling, 1318 tap prototype filter), which is 12 times higher than an optimized GPP (Intel I7 6850K) version. Last but not least, future steps for releasing and maintaining the code will be laid out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Wireless mobile traffic lights are often used to secure construction sites when roads are partially blocked. Some day, when a pair of them was placed close to our home, I set off to explore how they are working. In this talk, I will describe how I used a cheap RTL-SDR together with GQRX, Inspectrum, and GNU Radio to reverse engineer the modulation and frame format of different types of wireless traffic lights. With some patience, I could also make some sense out of the bits. In particular, I was able to extract the signal state and display it in a web interface, mirroring the traffic light. A closer look at the frame format and the apparent absence of any authentication might leave one with a bit of a worrying impression regarding the security of those systems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>A Signal Analysis Toolbox for GNU Radio</subtitle>
        <track>Software Defined Radio</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk copes with the signal analysis toolbox gr-inspector for GNU Radio. I will talk about the development process as well as the functionality and some usage examples.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Receiving unknown signals is hard. It was already possible with GNU Radio, but much manual work and offline tweaking was necessary. Real-time signal analysis was hardly possible.
During Google Summer of Code 2016, gr-inspector was developed to make these tasks more easy. The main purpose of the toolbox is to automate as much of a receiving process as possible during runtime. The components of the toolbox include a energy detection block, automated down-mixing/filtering/decimation, resampling, automated modulation classification (AMC) and OFDM parameter estimation/synchronization. Also, a GUI is able to display the analysis results.
In this talk, I will give information about the background of the toolbox, what it's capable of and how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Networked-Signal Processing in OAI</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Software Defined Radio</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide an overview of the evolution of OAI architecture to cater to distributed software radio systems, in particular those characteristics of upcoming cellular networks.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of radio communication networks will soon include by so-called “CloudRAN” technologies which refer to centralized radio-access infrastructure deployed in data-centers. Although exhibiting important differences in the type of processing they perform, the compute and storage architecture of these data-centers, as well as many of the software technologies, are very much modelled by those used by internet-based industries for information content management and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future network architecture is comprised of three segments, the so-called fronthaul network, the CloudRAN data-centers and the main data-centers.  The fronthaul network links the radio nodes at the extremities with the CloudRAN. These interconnection networks are typically optical links over very large distances (10-20 km) when the CloudRAN resides in the central office of an operator. Various technologies are envisaged including analog (radio-over-fiber) PON (passive optical network),  TDM and WDM PON and carrier grade optical Ethernet. Other solutions will also exist for indoor networks (e.g. airports, shopping malls, large administrations, private enterprise networks, etc.) using both optical and copper-based fronthaul networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software architecture of OpenAirInterface (OAI) is currently being evolved to cater to these distributed processing environments. In particular the infrastructure processing elements in OAI are being split at various places to allow them to be distributed between the central cloud processing units (RCC), the so-called radio-aggregation units (RAU) which perform centralized signal processing and switching and the network of remote-radio units (RRU). OAI now comprises two such processing splits which will be detailed along with examples of how to build simple ethernet-based RRU with low-cost commodity radio equipment (e.g. USRP B2x0, LimeSDR, etc.) and embedded PCs or ARM-based computers. In addition, The current architecture for deploying OAI in a data-center environment will be described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short live demonstration of networked-signal processing for 4G will be provided comprising a USRP-based RRU running on an UPBoard, an ethernet fronthaul and a mini radio-cloud-center housing the access protocol stack and a small core network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Virtual multi-antenna arrays for estimating the bearing of radio transmitters</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Software Defined Radio</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will present a new method to estimate the bearing of a radio transmitter with a mobile, single-antenna receiver, and its implementation on a software-defined radio (SDR) testbed.
The bearing estimation method relies on the following principle: by considering the signal received at several points along its trajectory, the receiver implicitly creates a virtual multi-antenna array (similarly to synthetic aperture radar systems) that can be used to estimate the bearing of the radio transmitter.
Virtual multi-antenna arrays have two major differences with conventional multi-antenna arrays: 1) the position and orientation of each antenna in the virtual array depends on the movement of the receiver and must be estimated; and 2) the local oscillator (LO) offset between transmitter and receiver adds a phase offset to the signal received by each “virtual” antenna, which must be estimated and compensated for.
The first problem is solved by using an inertial measurement unit (IMU), which can provide the relative position and orientation of the receiver for short time periods. The second problem is solved by expanding the signal model that is used in bearing estimation algorithms (such as MUSIC) to account for LO offset.
The proposed system is implemented on a USRP-N210 SDR with an external high-end IMU and tested in an anechoic chamber. The SDR implementation is a mixture of FPGA and software development, while some parts of the data are processed off-line. The results show that our method is indeed feasible, with bearing estimation errors of only a few degrees. We then present the first efforts of an implementation on a USRP-E310 SDR which has an integrated, lower-quality IMU.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ptb.de/cms/fileadmin/internet/fachabteilungen/abteilung_4/4.4_zeit_und_frequenz/pdf/2011_PTBMitt_50a_DCF77_engl.pdf"&gt;DCF-77&lt;/a&gt; is a German very low frequency (VLF) emitter locked on the Cs clocks of PTB used for synchronizing radiofrequency-disciplined clocks found, for example, in low-cost weather stations. VLF signals propagate through the waveguide whose boundary conditions are defined on the one hand by ground, and on the other hand by the ionosphere (charged) layer altitude. In addition to the amplitude modulation of the Cs-locked DCF-77 frequency standard, a &lt;a href="https://www.ptb.de/cms/en/ptb/fachabteilungen/abt4/fb-44/ag-442/dissemination-of-legal-time/dcf77/dcf77-phase-modulation.html"&gt;phase modulation&lt;/a&gt; is imprinted on the carrier for time of flight measurement, allowing for "precise" time of flight measurements. The topic of the presentation is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;reception of the DCF-77 VLF signal using a coil antenna, with enough power to feed a lock-in amplifier and extract phase and magnitude information. When the reference signal of the lock-in is referred to a local Cs primary standard, day/night ionosphere altitude variations are readily observed -- here using the carrier phase analysis,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;extraction of the time of flight through CDMA processing of the phase output from the lock-in amplifier, recorded on a (low frequency) oscilloscope, emphasizing the time resolution improvement of the phase modulation with respect to the amplitude modulation gained from the increased signal bandwidth,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;replace the lock-in amplifier with software-defined radio processing of signals recorded with a personal computer sound card or the analog to digital converter (RTL2832U) of a DVB-T receiver dongle,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;refer the second channel of the stereo sound card/DVB-T to a low-cost GPS 1-PPS time reference for local oscillator drift compensation, and hence measure the ionosphere altitutde variation through time of flight variation by comparing the phase-encoded cross-correlation peak position with the 1-PPS position, yielding results consistent with the lab-grade instrumentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although the whole processing chain is trivial, various issues making its practical implementation challenging will be emphasized. Most significantly, the processing chain is very similar to those applied to &lt;a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/xcorr/"&gt;GPS signals&lt;/a&gt;, yet easier
to grasp with the strong VLF signal. We aim at analyzing the time stability of the phase modulated signal -- allowing for sub-100 us timing resolution -- and correlated observed phase fluctuations with &lt;a href="https://www.funkamateur.de/tl_files/downloads/hefte/2006/DG9WF_Iono_lang.pdf"&gt;ionosphere altitude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Bareos (Backup Archiving Recovery Open Sourced) is a reliable, cross-network open source software for backup and recovery of data for a large set of operating systems (Linux, Unix, Windows, MacOS). This presentation will give an overview about what Bareos is and how to use its components. It will also highlight the latest stable features and present the roadmap for the next release.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bareos project stated in 2010 as a fork of Bacula.
Since then, lots of features have been introduced or enhanced, like Python-Plugin-Interface, VMware Plugin, Always Incremental, SCSI Crypto support, bareos-webui ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will give a general overview about what Bareos is and how it can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will highlight some of the unique features, tells what is currently in development and the roadmap for the next releases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Incremental Backups</title>
        <subtitle>Good things come in small packages!</subtitle>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Full backups of large storage devices are expensive, slow, and waste a lot of space. Incremental and differential backups are an oft-requested feature in virtualization stacks to help eliminate the redundant copying of backup data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will cover recent developments in related delta-backup technologies, covering incremental and differential backups, image fleecing, dirty bitmap management, and different paradigms of consuming this data to produce reliable backups both through QEMU as an agent or via an external backup appliance.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;Style&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the incremental backup functionality in QEMU and developments since its first introduction in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk is intended to be a fairly light-weight, quick trip through the feature; explaining the mechanics behind both the implementation and the API. I do not intend to cover in incredible detail the algorithmic minutiae of incremental backup techniques, but 'dirty bitmaps' as a fundamental technology enabling the technique will feature quite heavily. A theme of the talk will be how these features were implemented using targeted modifications to existing stable API to unlock rich functionality while maintaining backwards compatibility -- and the difficulties faced while doing so in a diverse open source environment. Current/Future developments are intended to be a highlight of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Audience&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, students who are interested in how large-scale projects tackle problems and would like some insight to how components in "the cloud" actually manage data on a technical level would find this talk interesting. At the very least, hopefully they find it entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, any developers or hobbyists who rely on virtualization in their workflow, but may not be heavily invested or well-versed in QEMU/KVM/libvirt et al specifically could benefit from an expanded knowledge of how this FOSS virtualization stack manages data. These users may be keen to gain insight into newer, more flexible storage and backup options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, Upper-layer stack developers or users who script against upper-layer virtualization stack components may be interested to hear what we're cooking up -- this includes libvirt, virsh, openstack, oVirt or any projects that count these projects as dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, anyone who has a keen appreciation for bad puns on slide captions might enjoy stopping by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees can expect to leave with a basic outline of the storage management solutions as they exist in FOSS virtualization today, and how we'd like to improve on them. With a copy of the slides and footnotes, attendees will be well equipped to author power-user scripts that take advantage of some advanced functionality in QEMU-kvm today that may help them eke out more mileage from their existing FOSS virtualization stack. The talk will cover general design, usage, current caveats and expected next steps for related backup features; this will hopefully provide generally relevant information for anyone interested in or contributing to the field in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>First steps with Relax-and-Recover (ReaR)</title>
        <subtitle>Understand how ReaR works by running it yourself. </subtitle>
        <track>Backup and Disaster Recovery</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;To get some initial basic understanding how Relax-and-Recover works
you will use it yourself on two virtual machines on your laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first virtual machine Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) will be installed
and used to prepare that machine for disaster recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second virtual machine is the replacement machine that is used
for disaster recovery of the first virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Preconditions for this workshop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To actively participate you need
a sufficiently powerful laptop
it that is ready-to-use prepared as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An NFS server runs on the laptop that exports a directory in "rw" mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two simple virtual machines are running on the laptop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;x86/x86_64 with BIOS (no UEFI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hardware virtualization (no paravirtualization)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a single virtual 20GB harddisk (IDE disk)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a usual virtual CDROM drive (IDE CDROM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a single usual virtual network interface card (no special driver/firmware)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small and simple Linux system is running on the first virtual machine
that is installed in a single ext3/ext4 filesystem with GRUB/GRUB2 as bootloader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Linux system running on the first virtual machine can access
the NFS server that runs directly on the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second "empty" virtual machine without an operating system
that is identical as the first one (BIOS, same 20GB harddisk, CDROM, same NIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preferably a recent ReaR version is installed on the Linux system
that is running on the first virtual machine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What will be done step by step:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not already done Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) will be installed
on the Linux system that is running on the first virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ReaR will be set up (configured) for disaster recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By running "rear mkbackup" on the first virtual machine
one gets on the NFS server a backup.tar.gz and a rear-hostname.iso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first virtual machine is shut down to simulate a disaster happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second virtual machine is booted from the rear-hostname.iso via CDROM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the special ReaR rescue/recovery system runs on the second virtual machine
and by running "rear recover" therein one gets on the second virtual machine
the system re-created as it had been before on the first virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) is a bare metal Disaster Recovery tool that can save you hours (and sometimes days) to recover a system from scratch in case of failure.
However, for us developers before making a new release it is a real nightmare to test all the different Linux distributions in combination with all
the known workflows that ReaR provides. It used to be a manual process of testing the recovery, but we are in progress to automate the whole process for some workflows.
We will explain the internals of how we do automated testing and we will give a live demo as well.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Introduction to  Bareos Backup Python Plugins</title>
        <subtitle>How to extend Bareos with Plugins written in Python</subtitle>
        <track>Backup and Disaster Recovery</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Bareos (Backup Archiving Recovery Open Sourced) is a reliable, cross-network open source software for backup, archiving and recovery of data for all well-established operating systems. Emerged from the Bacula Project in 2010, Bareos was and is actively developed as a fork and enriched with lots of new features. After a short introduction about the Bareos architecture and terminology, this session will introduce how to extend Bareos with Plugins written in Python.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using plugins makes it possible to extend the Bareos functionality. This allows to backup and restore in an application specific and more flexible and dynamic way than normal file backup. Use cases include database backups, agentless virtual machine backups or LDAP backups. Using Python makes this a lot easier, and with its large library for connectivity and API access it is possible to address a wide range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Bareos (Backup Archiving Recovery Open Sourced) is a reliable, cross-network open source software for backup and recovery of data for a large set of operating systems (Linux, Unix, Windows, MacOS).
Bareos offers a lot of tools for user interaction. The best known tool is the bconsole, offering a command line interface.
While it offers a lot of functions and can also be scripted, the Bareos JSON backend is much easier parse-able, especially when using the bareos-python module.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This presentation will show, how Bareos can be scripted.
It will give a overview about the existing tools (bconsole, bls, bscan, bareos-dir, ...),
with special focus to the Bareos Console.
It will show the Bareos Console feature, like commands, ACLs, JSON backend and scripting abilities.
Especially for the JSON backend, we show how this can be accessed by the python-bareos module.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Memcheck is probably the most heavily used tool in the Valgrind suite,
checking for invalid addresses, undefined values and memory leaks.  In
this talk I'll look back at the history of the tool, then I'll look
forwards at some of the challenges it faces as the hardware and
software ecosystem continue to evolve around it.  I'll talk a bit
about some of the effects of Memcheck on the C++ ecosystem and how it
fits into the big picture of making your big C++ app crash-free and
reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at Valgrind (Memcheck!) users and developers.  It
should be accessible to C/C++/Fortran developers who have used the
tool or are thinking of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SPARC is an instruction set architecture (ISA) originally developed by Sun Microsystems since 1980's.
Today's largest enterprise servers run on sparc, leveraging several terabytes of memory
and several hundreds of CPUs.
This talk will briefly introduce key concepts of sparcv9 ISA and the big picture where support
of a new architecture fits into Valgrind architecture. Some interesting problems during the port
will be discussed together with solutions and still-to-be-solved issues. Finally a live demo will
conclude the talk.
The talk assumes basic knowledge of Valgrind, interaction among Valgrind subsystems, basic assembly
and VEX IR notation. It is targeted to all interested in sparcv9 ISA and running Valgrind on sparc.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Valgrind and its different tools are providing a rich set of functionality
to track memory problems such as dangling pointers, memory leaks,
race conditions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will describe some old and new features that help to
understand what happens in your application.
Among others, we will give a demo and/or discuss:
  * how to use valgrind with your application specific memory pool
  * how to (interactively) ask Valgrind to describe a piece of memory
  * some heuristics used by Valgrind to reduce the number of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;'possibly lost' leaks with C++ code
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We will discuss more in detail the concept of execution trees,
which will be available in the next Valgrind release.
An execution tree associates stack traces of your program with some data.
Execution trees allow Memcheck and Helgrind to provide
a memory profile of your application. We will show how such an execution
tree memory profile can be visualised using tools such as
Massif visualiser or kcachegrind.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;gcc/glibc support fortification of some functions by defining &lt;em&gt;FORTIFY&lt;/em&gt;SOURCE. This inserts some compile and runtime buffer overflow checks for selected glibc functions. These checks have no or very little runtime overhead and work on the object level (the compiler provides/proofs the size of the object buffer size). valgrind memcheck provides similar memory buffer overflow checks. These checks don't need any compiler help (you won't have to rebuild your code). But they have a much higher runtime overhead. They also work on a different level. valgrind memcheck doesn't know anything about the objects the user is manipulation but has knowledge of all memory blocks allocated. Lets explore how these different mechanisms work and how we can make them work better together.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Successful and not (yet?) successful optimisations in Valgrind</title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Making Valgrind faster is a never ending challenge.
In this talk, we will describe 2 optimisations in Valgrind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A first optimisation is a speedup of Helgrind (a race detection tool).  A very
simple observation has led to an optimisation in the way helgrind captures
stack traces for its 'full recording' of where a piece of memory was
modified. This optimisation gives a typical speed up of 25%. We will describe
the issues encountered during the implementation and discuss the reasons
why this optimisation is not (yet?) committed in the Valgrind sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second optimisationis the implementation
of the execution tree concept : this generalises the way
Massif (a heap profiler) records the memory usage of a program.
We will show how a (maybe counter-intuitive) representation of a tree
using a hash table of flat stack traces has doubled the speed of
Massif for some workloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at Valgrind developers and any application developer
interested in data structures and algorithm optimisations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>VEX: where next for Valgrind's dynamic instrumentation infrastructure?</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Valgrind</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;VEX is the JIT at the core of Valgrind.  It unpicks blocks of machine
code, hands them off to the tool for instrumentation, recompiles the
result, and links the instrumented version into the running image.
By using a target independent intermediate representation, it insulates
tools from the complexity of the underlying instruction sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2003, when the framework was designed, I never dreamt that it
would end up supporting X86, ARM, POWER, MIPS, S390 and TILEGX in both
32- and 64-bit variants.  From that perspective VEX has been amazingly
successful.  But the framework is now showing its age.  Recent
instruction set features (transactional memory,
LoadLinked/StoreConditional, wide vectors) have proven difficult to
implement.  It supports precise memory exceptions only poorly.  And
perhaps worst, its simplistic compilation pipeline causes it to
generate code that is uncompetitive compared to other frameworks,
particularly DynamoRIO and PIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I'll outline VEX's structure, then talk about these
problems and what can be done about them.  And I'd be particularly
interested to hear opinions on how much effort, and for which problem
areas, should be invested in upgrading it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the audience, some background in compiler internals and assembly
code programming would be helpful, but is not essential.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The angr binary analysis platform (http://angr.io) uses libVEX as the base of its analysis engine. In this talk, we discuss the things about VEX that make it attractive for static analysis and symbolic execution, its pitfalls, and ways that it can be improved, including the changes we have made in our fork of libVEX.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Agenda
- The goals of static analysis and symbolic execution on binary code
- Brief overview of competing analysis IRs
- Design of angr structured around libVEX
 - PyVEX, FFI wrapper of libVEX objects into python
 - simuvex, symbolic implementation of most VEX operations, ccalls, and dirty calls
- Pitfalls we've encountered
 - VEX is not truly SSA
 - libVEX is not designed for fault tolerance
 - libVEX's multiarch support is a little shoddy
 - Licensing concerns
- Our patches to libVEX
 - The only real thing stopping us from submitting our patches upstream is manpower
- The possibility of a simplified python interface for writing lifters
- angr
 - symbolic execution
 - static analyses
  - control-flow recovery
  - binary rewriting
  - type inference (sort of)
  - value-set analysis&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Come and hack on Valgrind together. Open discussion about small (or big) ideas to improve or change Valgrind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valgrind developers and users are encouraged to participate either by submitting ideas/suggestions or by joining the discussion. And of course by kindly (or bitterly) complain about bugs you find important that are &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;YET&lt;/em&gt; solved for &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; many years!?@!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we will sit together and try to fix or implement some of the things discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Discuss any kind of possible improvement (technical or functional) to Valgrind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to put something on the agenda please send a small description (one or two paragraphs) to the the moderator Mark Wielaard &lt;a href="&amp;#x6d;&amp;#97;&amp;#x69;&amp;#108;&amp;#x74;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x6a;&amp;#x77;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x72;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#104;&amp;#x61;&amp;#116;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;"&gt;&amp;#109;&amp;#106;&amp;#119;&amp;#64;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x64;&amp;#104;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#x63;&amp;#111;&amp;#x6d;&lt;/a&gt; with in the subject: "FOSDEM devroom discuss: ..." If you want to discuss a somewhat larger topic please do feel free to send two or three slides in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark will collect ideas/suggestions/... and present these and coordinate the discussion (and keep track of the time, so every idea will be discussed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some discussion topic ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release/bugfixing strategy/policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we move to git yet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valgrind and transactional memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making Valgrind really multi-threaded, parallelising Memcheck, parallelising the rest of the framework, and tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instant leak detector. Modify memcheck to report the last leaked pointer to a block. Integrate "omega" as a memcheck option or omega as a separate tool.
http://www.brainmurders.eclipse.co.uk/omega.html&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make Callgrind work sanely on ARM (and PPC). The Callgrind algorithm to track call and return is to be improved to work properly on these platforms.
Is there a way to make this better? E.g. by having a fast way working in most cases, and rely on unwind info in the difficult cases.
Can we detect at instrumentation time that an instruction is a difficult case?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packaging valgrind for distros, handling patches, suppressions, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32-bit x86 vs modern instruction sets (avx, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VEX is in theory cross-architecture. What would it take to make valgrind cross-arch? How about starting with i686 on x86_64?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which CPUID is it anyway? Valgrind isn't completely consistent in handling host CPU capabilities vs VEX emulation capabilities. What can we do to improve that? Make it user tunable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;YOUR SUGGESTION HERE!&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And now is the time on Sprockets when we hack!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental aspect of the Genode OS project always was the support for various kernels as back-end. It remarkably raised testing versatility and provided a high flexibility to users and developers. But supporting the Genode API on self-contained third-party kernels is sometimes also accompanied with deficiencies, redundancies, or work-arounds. To also have the option of a basic kernel without such compromises, the custom Genode kernel was developed. Its main distinguishing mark may be that it not only trusts the Genode Core-component but even more is a mere library to it. The implications of this new design and other characteristics of the custom Genode kernel, such as scheduling, capabilities, and ARM virtualization, are discussed in this lecture.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

It decomposes key operating system functionality such as file systems, networking, device drivers and graphical user interface into a collection of fine-grained user space components that interact with each other via message passing. HelenOS does not aim to be a clone of any existing operating system and trades compatibility with legacy APIs for cleaner design. Most of HelenOS components have been made to order specifically for HelenOS so that its essential parts can stay free of glue code, franken-components and the maintenance burden incurred by them. In this talk I will do the annual HelenOS project update.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Deterministic replay support for Genode components: Performance penalty and challenges</title>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;we are modifying Nova kernel to make it support temporal redundancy for user processes running Genode components. Every time a process releases the CPU, we manage to restart it from its last starting point and re-run the same portion of the process code. An practical application of this could be an implementation of a fault tolerant system. At the end of the two executions, one may compare their memory footprints to detect an eventual fault due for example to SEU. We are also interested in the performance penalty this would induce on the overall systems compared to existing redundancy models.
In this talk, we will present how Genode components performances are impacted by this type of redundancy. Possible choices and remaining challenges for extending this model for multiprocessor environment will also be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Redox is an attempt to make a complete, fully-functioning, general-purpose operating system with a focus on safety, freedom, reliability, correctness, and pragmatism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we get there? By keeping the kernel minimal, both in terms of syscalls and in terms of size. By writing the code in Rust, a modern, memory-safe and type-safe systems programming language. By maintaining minimal privileges, through a general capability-based system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redox is an ambitious project, but it already runs on real hardware. Let's take a look.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Genode recently gained the ability to execute the same binary executables on kernels as different as seL4, NOVA, or Linux. Such kernel-independent executables are created via a regular tool chain and executed natively on the machine. The talk explains how it works, presents the challenges that had to be overcome, and gives an outlook of how Genode will leverage this ability in the future. The talk will be presented on a laptop running a Genode system and will be accompanied with live demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Embedded system development is a complex area in which the developers need to have a deep understanding of the underlying hardware with its configurations and interfaces, and one of the solutions to reduce this complexity is to utilize an operating system. This talk will introduce F9 microkernel aimed at low resources embedded systems powered by ARM Cortex-M microprocessors, allowing to perform real-time activities while keeping the drivers and the application isolated by a secure layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;F9 microkernel proved itself extremely small and simple to use while still maintaining the security of the system regarding the temporal constraints with a trusted computing base (TCB) as small as 3kLoC, which is important for safety, security and reliability in mission-critical embedded systems. This talk will also present the prototype at its early stages built to experiment with the idea of third-generation microkernels heavily inspired by seL4 for resource-constrained devices with fairly strong memory protection.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I wrote inet (the TCP/IP stack on MINIX) for two reasons: I like to come up with my own designs for everything and, most of all, I had to impress Andy Tanenbaum enough to become a Ph.D. student. Inet had to fit in with MINIX. In particular, it had to live with minimal changes to the MINIX code base. At the same time, there were quite a few areas where I felt sockets and the BSD TCP/IP implementation were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, there is a lot that I did not know and got wrong. I this talk, I will look at how inet follows the structure of MINIX, what works, and what went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The virtual file system (switch) is an instrinsic element of traditional operating systems and the majority of alternative OSes alike. For the most part, this is caused by existing applications that depend on the file abstraction and to some extent on a global view on system resources. In contrast, component-based OSes with strong security ambitions strive to apply the principle of least authority and shun one global view on the system. This was the starting for the VFS developments for Genode. The talk will present our design considerations and the current state of the VFS in Genode as a component and capability-based microkernel operating system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Virtualization is one aspect of our everyday life where multiserver
operating systems can shine.  Given the right underlying architecture,
one gets robust and fine-grained virtualization with little effort and
code.  Achieving the same on conventional monolithic systems requires
careful and invasive changes to the whole system, and the security
merely depends on the implementation at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk describes and demos how both fine- and coarse-grained
virtualization is implemented on the Hurd, and how virtualization
helps users gain freedom #0, i.e. the freedom to shape her computation
environment anyway she wants.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There are many IoT dashboards out on the web, most will require network connection to a server far far away, and use non standard protocols. We will show how to combine free software tools and protocols from the worlds of IT monitoring, Industrial control and IoT to create simple yet robust dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modbus [1] is a serial communication protocol developed in 1979 for use with programmable logic controllers (PLCs). In simple terms, it is a method used for transmitting information over serial lines between electronic devices., it’s openly published, royalty-free, simple and robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many industrial controllers can speak Modbus, we can also teach “hobby” devices like Arduino boards and ESP8266 to speak Modbus [2]. Reliable, robust and simple free software Modbus client [3] will be used to acquire the metrics from our device, then the metrics will be collected [6][7] and sent to Hawkular and Grafana [8] to store and visualize our data.&lt;/p&gt;

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll take a close look at a one of the "smart" (WiFi-connected) light-bulbs available on the market today. The bulbs expose a small API over UDP that I used to run an interface on a programmable buttons array. We will see how topics like reverse engineering, security, licensing, "self-hosting" and user experience came into play.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;monolight is an user interface to control LIFX WiFi-enabled light bulbs. monolight runs on a programmable button array; it is written in Python 3.6 (to have type annotations and asyncio), and it interfaces with the bulbs through a more complex daemon written in C: lightsd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will start with a live demo of the button grid remotely controlling the light bulbs. We will then explore how it works and some of the motivations behind it (network isolation, trying to not depend on the "cloud", reliability, user-experience). Finally, we will look into what kind of opportunities even more open IoT products could bring, and open leave the place to Q&amp;amp;A and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this project is to collect air quality information (fine dust particles) by means of a device that collects fine dust (PM1.0 and PM2.5) metrics. The device is mounted on bicycles to crowdsource factual air pollution information in and around the city of Ghent, Belgium and centralize that information for further processing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During this presentation we will look at the hardware and firmware design. New ideas and future extensions. But we also touch on the problems related to particulate matter and air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The device uses an ESP8266 with various sensors and output devices. The firmware is written in C++ using the Arduino framework.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Internet of things (IoT) is expected to connect billions of devices. The demand for an open IoT platform is increasing to enable and accelerate the development of cross-domain/cross-vendor use cases and face the accompanying challenges like connectivity with a wide range of heterogeneous protocols and large scale messaging. Eclipse IoT on top of Cloud Foundry is a promising software stack for this goal. However, it will only be successful if it is widely adopted. I will show you where we are today and we can find out together where to go tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is expected that in the next years billions of devices will be connected to the internet of things (IoT). Many of them will interact with cloud-based solutions to provide additional services on the devices or in the web. To bring IoT to the next level technologies for supporting cross-domain/cross-vendor solutions are needed. There is already a lot FOSS available to provide a technological base for building IoT solutions (e.g. Cloud Foundry). However, on top of it, software is needed for the connectivity challenges, support of domain-specific protocols, large scale messaging and device management and integration with existing infrastructure. Eclipse IoT aims to address these needs and provide an IoT framework that makes IoT development fast and simple. However, such an IoT platform can only be successfull if it is widely adopted. No-one can do I(o)T alone. I will show you where we are today and we can find out where to go tomorrow. Come and join us!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Building distributed systems with Msgflo</title>
        <subtitle>Flow-based-programming over message queues</subtitle>
        <track>Internet of Things</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MsgFlo is a tool to build systems that span multiple processes and devices, for instance IoT sensor networks.
Each device acts as a black-box component with input and output ports, mapped to MQTT message queues.
One then constructs a system by binding the queues of the components together.
Focus on components exchanging data gives good composability and testability, both important in IoT.
We will program a system with MsgFlo using Flowhub, a visual live-programming IDE, and test using fbp-spec.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;At the 2014 IoT devroom, we introduced flow-based programming (FBP) for heterogenous IoT systems, using NoFlo and MicroFlo.
The programming model worked well for individual devices, but between the devices of the system our solution caused too tight coupling.
When we realized this, we decided to build Msgflo, which reuses many of the same concepts and tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In MsgFlo each process/device is an independent participant,
receiving data on input queues, and sending data on output queues.
A participant do not know where the data comes from, nor where (if anywhere) the data will go.
This strong encapsulation gives good composability and testability.
MsgFlo uses a standard message queue protocol (MQTT or AMQP).
This makes it easy to use with existing software.
As each participant is its own process and communicate over networks,
they can be implemented in any programming language.
Convenience libraries exist for C++, Python, Arduino, Node.js and Rust.
On top of the message queue protocol, a simple discovery mechanism is added.
For existing devices without native Msgflo support, the discovery messages can be sent by a dedicated tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have used Msgflo in a handful of real-life deployments, and will demonstrate building a simple stand-alone IoT system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>6LoWPAN in picoTCP</title>
        <subtitle>And how to support new Link Layer types</subtitle>
        <track>Internet of Things</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;6LoWPAN enables, as the name implies, IPv6-communication over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks, e.g. IEEE802.15.4. A lot of resources are available to allow 6LoWPAN over IEEE802.15.4, but how can one extend the 6LoWPAN feature-set for the use with other link layer types? This talk will cover the details about a generic implementation that should work with every link layer type and how one can provide support for ones own custom wireless network. The goal is to give quite a technical and detailed talk with finally a discussion about when 6LoWPAN is actually useful and when is it not.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, as a summer project, I've implemented a generic 6LoWPAN adaption layer into picoTCP, an open source embedded TCP/IP-stack developed by Altran Intelligent Systems, with an eye on the IoT. I've made an effort to make the adaption layer as generic as possible allowing it to be easily expandable with new link layer types and topologies. The layer should also be able to allow multiple link-layer extensions, for post-network-layer processing. This could be used for mesh-under routing, link layer security, whatever you want. This talk will cover how one can take advantage of these features and caveats that come with it. I also have my personal thoughts on 6LoWPAN and I would like to share them with you at the end of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;JerryScript is a lightweight JavaScript engine designed to bring the success of JavaScript to small IoT devices like lamps, thermometers, switches and sensors. This class of devices tends to use resource-constrained microcontrollers which are too small to fit a large JavaScript engine like V8 or JavaScriptCore.
JerryScript is heavily optimized for low memory consumption and runs on platforms with less than 64KB of RAM and less than 200KB of flash memory. Despite the low footprint, JerryScript is a full-featured JavaScript engine implementing the entire ECMAScript 5.1 standard. It is actively used in production and already runs on more than one million smartwatches!
JerryScript is an open source project and has been released under the Apache License 2.0.
The talk will include a demo showing JavaScript code executing on top of JerryScript on a resource-constrained microcontroller.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>A low-cost device to help blind people live independently</subtitle>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Let's see how we can build small IoT devices that can help blind people in their daily life.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Word Health Organization estimates that more than 250 million people suffer from vision impairment, 36 millions of them being entirely blind. In many cases, their impairment prevents them from living independently. To complicate things further, about 90% of them are estimated to live in low-income situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Lighthouse was started by Mozilla to try and find low-cost technological solutions that can help vision-impaired people live and function on their own. To this date, we have produced several prototypes designed to aid users in a variety of situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a relatively low-tech presentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Scientific MicroPython for Microcontrollers and IoT</title>
        <subtitle>IoT programming with Python</subtitle>
        <track>Internet of Things</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;MicroPython is a FOSS implementation of Python 3 optimised to run on a microcontroller with MHz and tens or hundreds of Kbytes of RAM.  I will present MicroPython in terms of hardware and software, including some boards with network access, like WiFi, Bluetooth and LoRa. But even with these hardware constraints, scientific MicroPython is already available and practical, to be shown from the perspective of users and developers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;MicroPython is a implementation of Python 3 optimised to run on a microcontroller, created in 2013 by the Physicist Damien P. George. The MicroPython boards runs MicroPython on the bare metal and gives a low-level Python operating system running interactive prompt or scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MicroPython boards currently use 32 bit microcontrollers clocked at MHz and with RAM limited to tens or hundreds of Kbytes. These are the microcontroller boards with official MicroPython support currently in the beginning 2017 : Pyboard, Pyboard Lite, WiPy 1/2, ESP8266, BBC Micro:bit, LoPy, SiPy, FiPy. They cost between USD3-40, are very small and light, about some to tens of mm in each dimension and about 5-10 g, have low power consumption, so MicroPython boards are affordable and can be embedded in almost anything, almost anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MicroPython boards have many electronic interfaces : digital input/output (GPIO) ports, analog inputs (via Analog Digital Converter), analog outputs (via Digital to Analog Converter), wireless (WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa), etc. So MicroPython on these boards can be used to control all kinds of electronic projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of hardware, 2016 was the year of MicroPython, as new boards compatible with MicroPython arrived : ESP8266 boards (there are more than 10 types, with WiFi), BBC Micro:bit (with Bluetooth LE, free distributed to 1 million British students of 11-12 year-old), LoPy (with LoRa, WiFi, Bluetooth LE), SiPy (with Sigfox, WiFi, Bluetooth LE). Even a 5 network board was announced for April 2017 delivery, FiPy with LoRa, Sigfox, cellular LTE-CATM1/M2(NBIoT), WiFi, Bluetooth LE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of software, MicroPython allows microcontroller programming directly with Python 3, which is easier and more productive than programming with Arduino IDE, C/C++, etc. And MicroPython is well suited for Internet programming, so MicroPython boards are a natural choice for IoT (Internet of Things), for example running a simple web server to show a sensor output (text and graphics), sending sensor data to IoT cloud, etc. This fact is very important as today there are some billions of IoT devices worldwide, and in 2020 some tens of billions are expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with RAM constraints (tens to hundreds of Kbytes), scientific MicroPython is not only possible, but already available and practical to use, with MicroPython modules capable of numerical calculations, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), calculations with uncertainties, etc. I will list the scientific MicroPython modules which are available, as well as show how to port Python 3 modules to MicroPython, squeezing the source code in tens of Kbytes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some hints will be given to the FOSS community to be open minded about MicroPython : be aware that MicroPython exists, MicroPython is a better programming option than Arduino in many ways, MicroPython boards are available and affordable, porting more Python 3 scientific modules to MicroPython, MicroPython combines well with IoT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The OCF/IoTivity project aims to answer interoperability issues in the IoT world from many different contexts to accommodate a huge range devices from microcontrollers, to consumer electronics such as Tizen wearables or your powerful GNU/Linux system The vision of Iotivity is not restricted to ad hoc environment but also can be connected to Internet and make the service
easily accessible by other parties. With cloud access in place, usage scenarios for IoT devices can be enriched immensely.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we walk through the steps on how to practically handle IoT use cases that tailored towards various topologies. To introduce the approach used in IoTivity, we first give a detailed background introduction on IoTivity framework. Then we will present a demo that shows a few examples, from setting up a basic smart home network to accessing the IoT resource via a third party cloud service. Challenges and solutions will be addressed from development and implementation aspects for each step of the demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope this talk will inspire developers  to create new IoT prototypes using FLOSS,.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>An Open source IoT platform for large infrastructures</subtitle>
        <track>Internet of Things</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For FOSEM we would like to excite developers - who have interest in working on use-cases for Smart Cities, Utility Companies and other large-scale infrastructure companies - for the Open Smart Grid Platform. The Open Smart Grid Platform is an Open source IoT platform for large infrastructures. The platform allows you to monitor and control hardware in the public space. With several (generic) functions ready to use, the main benefits of the Open Smart Grid Platform are: scalability &amp;amp; high availability, high security, its  generic design, and no vendor lock-in.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Introduction
The Open Smart Grid Platform is an open source IoT platform. The open smart grid platform is a generic IoT platform, built for organizations that manage and/or control large-scale infrastructures.  The following use cases are now readily available: smart lighting, smart metering, tariff switching, and microgrids. Furthermore the following use-cases are in development: distribution automation, load management and smart device management.
The architecture of the open smart grid platform is modular and consists multiple layers. External applications are connected to a service domain via the integration layer. This integration layer contains web services. The service domain manages all the business rules such as: "Can we allow this change?”. The core component routes the messages to the correct protocol adaptor and contains generic functions such as device management, time synchronization and firmware management. The protocol adaptors convert the messages to a protocol that is used by the smart objects. This message could be a switching command, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open smart grid platform is highly unique for embracing the open source approach and the following key features:
•        Suitable for scalable environments delivering high performance
•        High availability and multitenant architectures
•        Built with security by design and regularly tested.
•        It has a generic architecture. More use cases and domains are easily added to the platform.
•        The open smart grid platform is based on open standards where possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information can be found on: http://opensmartgridplatform.org/ and
http://documentation.opensmartgridplatform.org/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposal talk
For FOSEM we would like to excite developers for our platform by discussing the reasoning behind the platform from a technical point of view and the architecture of platform. We believe the platform is interesting for developers who have interest in working on use-cases for Smart Cities, Utility Companies and other large-scale infrastructure companies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Wt is a C++ library for developing web applications and sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wt provides widget-centric API to write web application as if graphical application. Wt translates this to Ajax powered site or to plain HTML site depending on the client. Unlike page-based frameworks or single-page JavaScript frameworks, Wt creates stateful applications that are at the same time highly interactive but still support plain HTML browsers or web crawlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luawt uses all the power of Wt in the world of Lua. Luawt is different from popular solutions like Lapis and Sailor, because Wt is different. Target customer of luawt wants to provide web interface to a library, written in C or Lua. Luawt application can’t run directly from nginx.conf, but the application has per-session state and its code looks like GUI application's code. Luawt is not finished yet, but we have a number of solutions to automate generation of bindings using gccxml, so we expect it to become a practical solution very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to give a talk about luawt in order to show its facilities and demonstrate several examples how it could be applied in everyday web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homepage of luawt: https://github.com/LuaAndC/luawt
Luawt is delivered to you by Pavel Dolgov (github.com/zer0main) who is a CS student and open source developer and Boris Nagaev (github.com/starius) who is a site reliability engineer.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In my presentation I will focus on my project during Google Summer of Code program (mentor Hisham Muhammad). I will tell basic informations about this program and then continue to talk about our main goal, which was to increase quality of LuaRocks test suite, use new features from Lua unit testing framework busted and how to use / extend this suite. We implemented the new test suite with Lua unit testing framework busted and changed Continuous Integration practice.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;NodeMCU is an open hardware IoT platform based on eLua for the ESP8266 microcontroller. It allows creating low-cost projects using Wi-Fi and easy scripting in Lua, which makes it great for making wearables, for example. In this talk I'll give an introduction to the platform, show how I built an audio reactive graduation dress and share the materials to get you started on your own wearable project. This talk is ideal for beginners to hardware hacking or Lua enthusiasts looking for project inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I will be discussing recent work by my team to use the Eclipse OMR JitBuilder technology to improve the Lua interpreter performance. I will show the small changes required in the runtime to take advantage of the OMR JitBuilder technology, show the performance improvements and discuss the trade offs of using a JIT.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Eclipse OMR project consists of a highly integrated set of open source C and C++ components that can be used to build robust language runtimes that will support many different hardware and operating system platforms.  The talk will be focused mainly on the Compiler technology and specifically the JitBuilder and how it could be used by the Lua runtime. You can read more about the Eclipse OMR project at https://www.eclipse.org/omr/ and view the code at https://github.com/eclipse/omr. I will make a version of the Lua runtime source code with our changes available so everyone can look through and ask questions or provide feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will present the latest improvements done for ARM64 and MIPS64 platforms in LuaJIT. The talk will cover challenges related to new GC64 mode, as well as arch-specific issues.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Up to recently, the only 64-bit architecture that LuaJIT supported was x86_64 and in the latest official release it had limits with addressable memory. In the meantime, new GC64 mode was finished which enabled LuaJIT to address 47-bit address space. ARM64 and MIPS64 ports were done on the top of the new GC64 mode. We will discuss the current status of these ports and point out some pending issues that could cause problems in today's software that uses LuaJIT. The talk will also be useful to those interested to port LuaJIT to another architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The guile implementation of scheme provides a Turing complete
language enabling any computable problem to be solved.
In the community however there is a perception that scheme is not suited to
user interface applications.
This talk discusses why that perception exists, and aims to counter it
by presenting an example of graphical user interface application using
guile-ncurses which may be used to configure and install the GuixSD
operating system on a bare computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The structure of the program will be briefly presented, how it uses
the guile-ncurses library and issues which were encountered during
its development&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A more informal talk about how to use Emacs &amp;amp; Geiser, or the commandline REPL to hack on Guile projects.

After this I want to open up the platform to get people to suggest some of their favourite REPL based workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Composing system services in GuixSD</title>
        <subtitle>or how we came to wonder what a "system service" really is</subtitle>
        <track>GNU Guile</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;What's a "system service"?  How do we model that in GuixSD?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In most people’s mind, system services are a bunch of daemons that simply need to be started at boot time, or whenever they are actually needed.  Possibly services form a dependency graph, and possibly they are actions other than spawning a daemon, such as mounting a file system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, the devil is in the detail, and reality is that “system services” on a modern GNU/Linux system—with udev, dbus, polkit, along with more traditional Unix services—include lots of different “activities”, with lots of interactions among them.  That naive picture of a graph of services no longer works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is going to tell the story of system services in GuixSD.  GuixSD started from the naive visions of a “dependency graph of actions” to evolve into a generic model of service composition.  I will describe what makes GuixSD’s service composition model unique, and how it helps users and sysadmins reason about the whole system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Explore Guile's role in advancing network freedom!  This talk covers recent advancements in asynchronous tooling in Guile, as well as live demonstrations of Guile used to power federation via the ActivityPub and ActivityStreams standards through Pubstrate.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Much has happened over the last year in terms of advancing network freedom both within and external to Guile. We'll see a live demonstration of Pubstrate, a federated social networking toolkit as well as reference implementation for &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/"&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/"&gt;ActivityStreams&lt;/a&gt;, written in and for GNU Guile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous programming has also gotten much more interesting in the last year for Guile hackers, with improvements in Guile core and new libraries such as 8sync, A-Sync, and Fibers. An overview of these systems will be given, as well as suggestions on how you can get hacking towards liberating network users today!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Arne Babenhauserheide :enthusiastically:
    I want to present the newest step
    on my path towards the perfect 
    text RPG scripting syntax.

The Jury
    What is special about it?

Arne Babenhauserheide
    It does away with ceremony
    by following the format used
    to write for human actors
    without sacrificing
    any of the power of writing
    in a real programming language.

The Jury
    Did you not hint at a prototype
    of such a system at FOSDEM 2016?

Arne Babenhauserheide
    Yes, and now it works well!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

R6RS Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will show the current state of Mes, some interesting things found on

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Combining programs to perform more powerful actions using scripting languages
seems a good idea, until portability and parallel execution on computing
clusters become the main concerns of the script.  GNU Guix used GNU Guile as a
domain-specific language to describe software packages.  In the same way, the
components that make up a workflow description can be expressed using
GNU Guile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I would like to present the work I have done to implement a simple
workflow language and a workflow execution engine (both in GNU Guile) to run
programs on computing clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;wiredtiger is a NoSQL database engine. Often dubbed key/value store, we will see that indeed it can be used like leveldb, bsddb or GNU dbm as a simple (ordered) hashmap but also as a (performant) framework for data persistence that can replace your favorite SQL queries with Scheme goodness (and pieces of minikanren).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The session will look at the issues developers run into when developing their own WebRTC applications. It looks at the problematic elements in the API, the compatibility problems between browsers, missing infrastructure, and even the human element. All in all, it's a demonstration that a true WebRTC application can't be built in a snap.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I presented a talk explaining how easy it is to build a WebRTC application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I'll tell you the truth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will cover both the ideas and code necessary to move your basic application into something that resembles production-ready.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Jitsi offers seamless and secure multiparty video conferencing while being 100% Open Source. Come and see what's new in Jitsi land! This talk will dive into the latest developments in the Jitsi Videobridge such as simulcast support and the new React Native based Jitsi Meet, the video groupchat client which just went mobile.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Jitsi started out as "SIP Communicator" back in 2003 and has been in the forefront of Real Time Communications ever since.  One of Jitsi's biggest innovations was the introduction of the videobridge, which made video groupchat possible.  Lately the Jitsi team has been focused on adding new features to the videobridge such as simulcast along with the development of a React Native based client for mobile platforms.  All of this while being secure and 100% Open Source!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>A WebRTC SFU for Node.js</subtitle>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;mediasoup is a WebRTC SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) for Node.js that allows applications to run multiparty video conferencing with browser and mobile devices in a multi-stream fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Rather than being yet another standalone media server, mediasoup is a Node.js library/module which can be easily integrated within existing applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mediasoup exposes both, the ORTC API and the WebRTC API (same as in browsers), allowing the application to program multiparty video conferencing via JavaScript. mediasoup is minimalist, it just focuses on media handling. It does not provide, nor it mandates, a specific network signaling protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will expose the technology behind mediasoup, the API it exposes, and a demo application the assistants will be able to join.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>How to use XMPP and Converse.js to integrate webchat into any website</subtitle>
        <track>Real Time Communications</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Converse.js is an XMPP-based webchat application that can be used standalone or which can be customized and integrated into any website.
In this talk we'll take a closer look at the architecture of Converse.js, and how you can use plugins to extend and customize it for your needs.
I'll also explain the infrastructure required to host XMPP-based webchat (regardless of whether you're using Converse.js or not).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;What is XMPP?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I'll provide a brief introduction to XMPP (as presence and chat protocol) and the two main technologies for integrating XMPP into the webbrowser (long-polling with BOSH versus websockets). I'll disuss federation and how XMPP allows people from different services to communicate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What is Converse.js?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next follows an introduction to Converse.js, which is a webchat client that can be used standalone, or which can be integrated into any website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A brief history of Converse.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I'll talk about how Converse.js came to be, what it was originally used for, where it's been integrated and what's been done with it since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How to integrate webchat into your website&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, I'll provide an outline of what's needed to create a webchat solution for your website. I'll mention XMPP servers, BOSH connection managers, XEPs (XMPP protocol extensions) that you'll likely want to enable, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting your hands dirty by customizing Converse.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief tour of Converse.js's technical architecture will follow, and I'll explain how you can customize it, or extend it's functionality with plugins. I'll show two customization examples, embedded groupchat and a full-screen chat application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Plans for the future&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll then finish off by discussing plans for future improvements and enhancements to Converse.js&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Internet has shifted to the current 128-bit IP protocol but some networks are still lagging behind. This talk is about issues with the dual stack scenario, changes to protocols needed and real world experiences of implementations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIP was written for both IPv4 and IPv6, but not for both at the same time. The talk is about experiences from SIPit tests, code and real world implementations on mobile networks - what happens with your software when being faced with both protocols? Can this affect your old IPv4-only implementation as well? What is the best option when my software crashes and generates core dumps?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Quality of Service markings can benefit real time traffic. A survey we
conducted on a mobile cellular testbed (Monroe) has revealed how
differentiated services traffic is treated in practical networks, and shows
many networks do not respect diffserv markings resulting unpredictable
real-time performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This motivates a change to the network programming API for real-time traffic
to provide dynamic transport selection and fallback, enabling successful use
of network QoS. The API is presented in the context of the NEAT&lt;a href="https://neat-project.org"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; open
source project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Metre is an XMPP Server, but not one that serves XMPP. Instead, it lives in the nether regions between servers - being a Man In The Middle by design and intent - filtering and securing traffic as required.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Metre supports pretty well every bell, whistle, and in fact any other musical instrument of XMPP Server to Server security. It then filters traffic, drops stanzas you don't want, eliding it totally on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'll throw your traffic over TLS, over DANE, over SATCOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'll log it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'll protect your autonomous security domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'll wag its little tail when it sees you in the morning, but you won't have to take it for walks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the modern real time communication world, WebRTC is being paired with multiple channels and services to provide an unparalleled customer experience.
Utilizing automated speech recognition allows us to build advanced assistive services such as real time captioned phone calls for hearing impaired people, simultaneous translation tools and automated bot assistants.
All of that can be achieved leveraging modern open source software such as Adhearsion, the Ruby telephony application framework, FreeSWITCH, Flite, PocketSphinx and (optionally) external APIs such as IBM Watson.
Our experience in developing that kind of service will be presented and discussed, plus code samples and a live demo.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wrapping FreeSWITCH's WebRTC capabilities with Adhearsion acting as the call logic and the "glue" between parts makes creating rich ASR-enabled applications easier.
Adhearsion allows you to leverage the full power of Ruby to access APIs, send messaging and updates, and use databases.
Integrating FreeSWITCH with third party APIs who do not provide a direct interface, such as IBM Watson and Wit.ai, through Adhearsion and Ruby. ASR and sentiment analysis will provide our IVRs with an unparalleled ability to not only understand what callers say, but also what their desires and intent are. Dialplan applications can be complex to set up to use those APIs, and web applications are not well suited to that type of application. Adhearsion, the Ruby voice application framework, makes it easy and fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I am going to present modern concurrency tools provided by concurrent-ruby gem http://concurrent-ruby.com&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These modern concurrent tools provided by concurrent-ruby gem are inspired by Erlang, Clojure, Scala, Go, Java, JavaScript, and some classic concurrency patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will go through detailed examples about how to use each of the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also going to cover little theory of classic concurrency models such as CSP, Actor Model, Event based so that we will understand importance of these modern concurrency features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will be very useful for modern Rubyist to understand concurrency abstractions those can be used at application code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A People's History of the Ruby Garbage Collector</title>
        <subtitle>Ruby GC from 1.8 until 2.4 and beyond!</subtitle>
        <track>Ruby</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;C Ruby's garbage collector has come a long way since the good old days of Ruby 1.8. We'll walk through over 20 years of GC history in the C Ruby runtime, and along the way we'll talk about the key features that were added with each Ruby version. We'll cover the 5 (!) different GC algorithms C Ruby has used since 1.8, copy-on-write optimization, and possible optimizations for the future. No prior knowledge of GC or the C Ruby runtime is required for this talk.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;By covering the long and varied history of Ruby GC, this talk ends up being a general introduction and discussion of concepts in garbage collection in high-level languages. We'll cover the 5 different algorithms Ruby has used, copy-on-write optimization, and how the Ruby C API has sometimes held back garbage collection in the runtime. I'm aiming this talk at people who have never thought about such topics before, but have a few years of Ruby experience under their belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3 minutes) How and Why of GC - the Ruby Heap and how it works
(5 minutes) 1.8 - Mark and Sweep GC
(5 minutes) 1.8 REE - Copy on Write Optimization
(5 minutes) 1.9 - Lazy Sweep
(5 minutes) 2.0 - Bitmap Marking
(5 minutes) 2.1 - Generational GC
(5 minutes) 2.2 - Incremental GC
(2 minutes) 2.3 - Introducing the Write Barrier&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a pretty novel topic - I don't think anyone has ever presented the whole history of the Ruby garbage collector before! It's also a great introduction to garbage collection in general because we start with the simple algorithm in Ruby 1.8 and gradually add new layers and complication onto it, until we end up with the sophisticated GC of Ruby 2.3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been debugging and writing about issues in Ruby memory usage for some time now, and I think we could all benefit from plugging up this "leaky abstraction" in our Ruby knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle/>
        <track>Ruby</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Even if mruby core works on Windows, any mruby app is may not work if the libraries it depends on don’t compile and run on Windows. Using Rust, we can work towards building an ecosystem that is Windows compatible. This talk walks through building mruby libraries that do that.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlike some other languages like JavaScript, Java, or Python, Ruby is not known for it’s ability to run well on Windows. The Windows environment is often treated as a second or third class citizen even though there are many potential users. Part of this is due to Ruby’s strong POSIX oriented standard library. This has mostly been ok since most Ruby applications are hosted and run on UNIX servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mruby is a lightweight Ruby that can be linked and embedded inside other applications. Being embeddable means that the runtime host could be Windows. mruby also has no Operating System specific standard library. Since the ecosystem is young, there’s potential for an ecosystem that is Windows friendly. But writing cross platform native extensions in C for mruby is still difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust is a modern systems programming language that is fast and built to prevent segfaults and guarantee thread safety. It’s more than just a compiler, it’s a platform that has a great dependency manager and cares about cross compilation out of the box. This makes it a great candidate over C to write native extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll go over some basic Rust and how we can integrate this to write mruby libraries that compile on Linux, OS X, and Windows. It’ll dig into not only writing the library code, but also the mruby C API as well as the mruby/Rust binding layer that makes this all possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I worked on “Port NMatrix to JRuby” in the context of GSoC 2016. The performance of NMatrix-JRuby is outstanding even without making use of JRuby threading capabilities. Also, I am working on ArrayFire gem that helps in easy GPU computation and is 1e4 to 1e7 times faster than NMatrix gem&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;JRuby is known for performance. NMatrix, a linear algebra library, now supports JRuby. All SciRuby gems that depend on NMatrix can now be run on JRuby. A scientific library must be highly efficient as the programs can be memory intensive. The programs must be fast at the same time. This calls for optimization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose, you are running a Ruby program and you need to make it faster; you use threads, yet you are not happy with the results! Just chain the Ruby methods to Java methods. Using Java method can improve the speed, around 1000 times when compared to using Ruby method. Not only speed, it can help you save a lot of RAM, around 10 times. JRuby’s Garbage Collection can sometimes slow down your program if you are not careful with handling a large amount of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to share about ArrayFire gem that would be soon available for MRI that can be used for high-performance GPU computing using OpenCL/CUDA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

When it comes to Pokémon GO, I keep the Pokémon individual values (IV), maximum combat powers (CP), and other information that calculated from 3rd-party websites on my spreadsheets, in order to plan which Pokémon to spent precious resources to power up.  The spreadsheet document eventually becomes an application that works completely off-line.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Toolbars are a common toolkit control that have been around since the dawn of GUI applications, providing direct access to an application's most frequently used functions. But with increasing scope, the number of frequently used functions grows to an extent that can have a detrimental impact on quickly locating a particular item. LibreOffice made it possible to create UI based toolbars on blank canvas where designers have all the freedom to do whatever they want with the space. The talk will present the reasoning behind the Notebookbar layout with contextual groups.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will present two ways of working with LibreOffice user interface elements for an extension or a macro - legacy Basic dialog designer, as well as the  new feature using .ui files editable by Glade&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;User interface for LibreOffice extensions and macros has never really been in the spotlight of attention of LibreOffice developers and users despite the fact that built-in dialog designer was pretty advanced piece of software in its time. It still contains quite some powerful features (such as drag-and-drop editor, live preview or easy access to l10n). And while core LibreOffice dialogs have been converted to modern .ui format (thus making it possible for LibreOffice developers to use even more powerful UI editor - Glade), LibreOffice peripherals were still stuck with legacy home-grown obscure formats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come and see for yourself that extensions and macros don't have to be dull, interfaceless pieces of software and that with minimum effort and basic knowledge of UI design, you can make them rock. Now you can even use all the capabilities of Glade as .ui format can be read by/included in extension or macro as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Currently the LibreOffice help system is based on a technology developed circa 2005, and uses the internal Writer - Web module to display its contents. This presentation introduces our efforts to bring the LibreOffice Help system into a modern 2017 technology, preserving our legacy contents and l10n processes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently the LibreOffice help system, here forth called HC2 is based on a technology developed circa 20051, and uses the internal Writer - Web module to display its contents.
HC2 uses a combination of XML and XLST technology to display contents in Writer/Web and is historically bounded to HTML version 3.2 . As a consequence, the HC2 misses multimedia resources such as videos, animations as well as a modernized concept of CSS and Javascript for better user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the HC2 XML schema (XHP) requires special tools (HelpAuthoring) for editing its contents and a simple inspection on the schema indicates most of its elements are now part of W3C standard HTML5, turning XHP almost obsolete. Current help authoring tools are buggy and requires steep learning curve for the unskilled volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;History of LibreOffice XML Help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LibreOffice Help System was designed and implemented in 2005 by SUN Microsystems ant the times where the "Browswer war" raged and no standard published by W3c was adopted in full by the major browser players. The WWW hijack by major corporations was played in the browser battlefield, twisting specs and invalidating page rendering to build fences around browsers and servers and creating silos of web display technologies;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SUN Microsystem adopted an internal only solution, with a A specific XML (XHP) to hold  contents and navigation and an internal browser (Writer Web), that beared a resticted HTML 3.2 specification,  together with a C++ wrapper to create index and proper calls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2017 issues for Help System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current (2005) help system is in a state that is is complex edit/update contents, hard to test and visualize results. There is no rich text available except an authoring extension to LibreOffice that uses Writer as rich text editor but has several issues in exportng and importing xhp files. To use this extension features is as hard as learning XHP itself and as hard as to attempt to edit content with a simple text editor as vim or emacs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthemore the rich text authoring is bounded to the current XHP schema, doubling the effort when it comed to evolove XHP, because the tools must follow the new schema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current HTML 3.2 implemetation with LibreOffice Writer / Web rendereing engine, is also bounded to simple images and text, and no video nor another multimedia resource is avalable for the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;General requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new help system for LibreOffice must support important requirements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must preserve legacy contents, composed into thousands of XHP files covering all 6 LibreOffice modules and an internal user guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must also preserve the dozens of translations done on these legacy XHP files and the translation process must be ideally preserved or incur in the least perturbation possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must use open, royalty free standars of web technologies, supoort all major browsers of 2017, OS independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be of easy access, low entry barrier for newbies, volunteers an have support of ease of use editing tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be perfectly handled by git version control&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must work Off-line and on-line&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strategy of the project is in 2 pieces&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Progressively phase out XHP and phase-in HTML5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML5 is a serious candidate to deserve our efforts to bring back our hep content into a general purpose rendering technology, suport moder CSS, javascript, other companion technologies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Develop a micro javascript server capable of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display the correct help page required by the LibreOffce applicaiton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use most of the resources such as navigation history, bookmarking, caching incluced in any major browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handle indexing and searching text among pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support XHP and HTML simultaneously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Demo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will demo where we are at the moment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Concusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the cost of a technology adoption is its capability to be quickly absorbed by its target audiences. Documentation and help systems plays a key role for the adoption of LibreOffice not only in the home but also in the corporations. Having a dynamic and rich help content that can make users feel the better experience in seeking help is a key step LibreOffice project is taking to inclrease its popularity. The project described here is our current status and will be real very soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"But what about the extensions?" can be the death knell for whatever cool new feature somebody tries to implement in LibreOffice, as extensions naturally ask for interface stability.  But what about them, anyway?  Are they the saviour that brings diversity to our desktops, or are they just a ghostly phantom that stifles innovation?  Lets take a look at the extension landscape out there.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenOffice Basic is cool.  It can manipulate everything in your document, spreadsheets and slides.  It helps you to create complicated reports automatically.  But OpenOffice Basic is not cool.  It lacks everything a modern hardcore developer needs:  Personal favorite text editors, version controls, source repositories, etc.  OpenOffice Basic macros are created and edited only with Basic IDE, and stored in some hidden place in your hard disk, not in the source form but in XML.  They cannot be managed with modern development tools like svn, git, different text editors, and cloud storage backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if there is a tool that let you work off-line, out of the OpenOffice Basic IDE box, with your favorite text editor, on anywhere on your hard drive?  That's why I wrote obasync to do this job: Synchronize your local Basic macro sources with OpenOffice Basic storage.  It frees me from Basic IDE and I can apply every source code development tools now.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The LibreOffice build system provides integration with a set of IDEs including Kdevelop, Eclipse, Vim/YouCompleteMe, QtCreator and Visual Studio. This allows developers on all platforms to use their preferred environment and still IDE features like code-completion on many of them without the need to manually maintain all of those. Gbuild, the LibreOffice build system, exports most relevant data about this to JSON files, which then can be used to create project solutions on multiple IDEs. This talk describes how we got there, past and future challenges and opportunities. It might also be of interest for other projects interested in providing something similar.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The crash reporter showed that the LibreOffice project has a serious update problem with users using old versions and not updating to newer versions. The talk will present the work on the automatic updater as well as the approach to collect some user statistics to improve the crash reporter.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the Mozilla updater code an automatic updater has been under development for the LibreOffice project for quite some time. Based on the experiences with the crash reporter the need for an automatic updater has been shown to be a serious problem for the project. The talk will show the current approach used in the automatic updater code, open challenges and how this allows to rethink the installation and packaging experience. Based on the prototype server the talk will also show how the server can be used to generate am estimation for active daily users (ADU) and how the information about the number of ADU can be used to enhance other services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The LibreOffice project has become a large software development project. To better understand how it is being developed, a software development analytics dashboard has been deployed for it. This dashboard tracks most of the public data about LibreOffice development, and it allows to visualize, drill down and understand that data. The talk will present this dashboard, and will explain how to interpret the data it provides.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Document Foundation Development Dashboard visualizes data obtained from some systems used to support LibreOffice development: git, Gerrit, Bugzilla... The data is retrieved from them, stored, organized an massaged in a database, and later visualized in the dashboard. The dashboard permits to track activity (in commits, issues, pull requests, questions and answers, etc.), actors (who is creating the code, who is fixing bugs, who is answering questions), and processes (hot long does it take to close issues, or to accept pull requests).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Document Foundation Development Dashboard has been deployed using GriomoireLab, an complete FOSS system for retrieving data from software development repositories, storing it, and producing different kinds of analytics, dashboards and reports.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Document Foundation Development Dashboard shows detailed data about how LibreOffice is being developed. It also allows for drilling down, filtering, and understanding it. The talk will explore some of these possibilities, by showing how to look for specific data, for customizing the results, and for sharing the results with others.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Document Foundation Development Dashboard visualizes data obtained from some systems used to support LibreOffice development: git, Gerrit, Bugzilla... The data is retrieved from them, stored, organized an massaged in a database, and later visualized in the dashboard. The dashboard allows not only to browse the data, but also to drill down and play with it. The dashboard permits to track activity (in commits, issues, pull requests, questions and answers, etc.), actors (who is creating the code, who is fixing bugs, who is answering questions), and processes (hot long does it take to close issues, or to accept pull requests).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Document Foundation Development Dashboard has been deployed using GriomoireLab, an complete FOSS system for retrieving data from software development repositories, storing it, and producing different kinds of analytics, dashboards and reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will explain how to interact with the data provided by the dashboard for finding any detail of interest. The talk will also provide hints on how to exploit the data behind the dashboard to obtain specific information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Rolling Releases are the future of Linux distributions.
They are already the better solution for power users &amp;amp; developers.
The methodologies, techniques, and capabilities of Tumbleweed are opening up new doors, creating possibilities, and disrupting existing technologies beyond its borders.
This session will explain how and why openSUSE Tumbleweed is paving the way for that future, while already being "the reliable rolling release".
The talk will dispel the fears, uncertainties and doubts that many have regarding rolling releases in general and Tumbleweed specifically, and share how you can get involved both using, and improving, this exciting fast moving foundation of the openSUSE Project.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The audience is anyone interested in using recent versions of the Linux kernel or other upstream projects. This includes not only enthusiasts, but developers, especially Linux kernel developers and other developers of fast moving stacks who often benefit from having a stable platform with all the latest libraries and binaries available to them.
Attendees can expect to get a solid understanding of how Tumbleweed is developed, it's strengths and benefits, as well as a comparison with Tumbleweed to other similar Linux-based rolling distributions.
This presentation will encourage a broader adoption of rolling releases and the mentality, methodologies and capabilities that come with it.
Tumbleweed and other similar rolling releases are key platforms to enable the high speed development of the Linux kernel and other key ecosystem components which increasingly move at a faster pace than 'traditional' Linux distributions can keep up. Rolling releases are also the natural platform for not only the development but the early adoption of key emerging technologies such as Containerisation and NFV.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;To publish it's documentation, SUSE has developed not only a comprehensive Open Source toolchain to create and publish documentation but also an open workflow that allows community and partners to provide feedback and contribute. These tools and processes can easily be adopted by other projects to write high quality software documentation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;SUSE has been around as Linux vendor for a long time and from it's early days onwards, delivered not only software but also the documentation to use it. In fact, SUSE is not only writing the documentation for it's own distributions but for upstream projects like OpenStack as well. Over time, the SUSE documentation team has developed not only a comprehensive, completely Free and Open Source toolchain to create, edit, manage, and publish documentation but also an open workflow that allows community and partners to provide feedback and contribute. These tools and processes can easily be adopted by other projects to write high quality software documentation, everything from a man page to a reference guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Christoph will introduce the complete SUSE/openSUSE documentation workflow and tool chain. It will cover both the technical details like formats, tools, or branching model and the organizational aspects such as the feature planning and tracking, distribution of work and feedback process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Getting a new Linux appliance with every commit you push sounds awesome but impossible, right? Not with the Open Build Service, the Free Software build and distribution system which powers openSUSE, ownCloud and Tizen! Usually a lot of manual work is necessary to create your custom Linux appliance, but the Open Build Service abstracts all the complicated technologies and makes this task as easy as pie. In this talk, we will show you how we plug several open source technologies together to create Linux appliances in a fully automated, continuous integration cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;Starting with a commit to your favorite version control system, the OBS will build a ready-to-use image of an operating system for you automatically, using the power of KIWI. And to finish the continuous integration cycle, openQA will run automated tests to make sure your appliance still works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you still manually build and test your Linux appliances, this talk is for you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Following the progress of the Modularity initiative and Factory 2.0 developments in Fedora, it's about time we define what the next, modular operating system should look like, focusing on the developer’s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This first half of this talk will present the main concepts of Modularity, explaining in detail what modules are, how they get built, composed, distributed and kept updated once deployed on the target system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the talk will explore the idea of the so-called Generational Core, often also referred to as Base Runtime — a modular platform base on top of which application modules can both be built and executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both these topics cover ongoing efforts and we don’t yet have definitive answers to all the questions. We’ll talk about what we learned in the past year, what problems we’re trying to solve and our plans for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;While small updates normally don't disturb the services running on your system, bigger or intrusive updates can break your running services or Desktop. There are different ways of doing transactional updates like new package formats or different partitions. This talk will show how to use the features of btrfs for this with traditional package managers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Applying small updates is normally no problem in a running system. But what about if there is a new major release of your favorite Desktop? Or a major version update of your used Linux distribution? Today’s concepts are most of the time to apply the patches in the running system and risk that a running service or Desktop breaks, or apply them all by booting an installation media and wait for quite some time until you can access your machine again.
A solution for this are transactional updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transactional updates are atomic, means either they applied successful, or if an error occurred, you have the same state as before. And if an update does not work, there is an easy way to go back to the last working state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different solutions for this, some require new package formats, other require a second partition and you can switch during the next reboot to the other partition.
I want to present a third solution: using a standard package manager and leverage btrfs for this.
With snapshots and rollback on btrfs, there is already everything available what you need. This talk will give a short introduction into snapshots and rollback with btrfs and show how to combine and use this technologies to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Deploying NPM packages with the Nix package manager</title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Nix is a package manager providing a number of unique features to automate deployments in a reliable and reproducible way. It serves as the basis of the NixOS Linux distribution (that can be automatically installed from a single declarative specification), as well as a number of additional deployment solutions, such as NixOps, that deploys virtual machines in the cloud and Hydra: the Nix-based continuous integration server. Although Nix offers all kinds of deployment benefits, integration with language-specific package managers that also do dependency management, such as the NPM package manager, is problematic as they conflict with Nix's reliability properties. In this presentation, I will show &lt;code&gt;node2nix&lt;/code&gt;, a tool that automatically generates Nix expressions (build recipes) from
an NPM package's &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; configuration file, allowing users to deploy NPM packages with the Nix package manger alongside other types of packages (e.g. Autotools, Perl, Python, ...) that constitute a large complex system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I try to address the following target audience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System administrators/DevOps:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people who typically deploy entire software systems in which parts of them might be Node.js applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NPM makes it less convenient to use a single intergrated deployment solution, e.g. you might need to use both NPM and the host system's package manager + additional scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;solution requires on external distribution channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distro packagers:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some types of software are hard to package and as a result difficult to include with e.g. a Linux distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Especially if source package uses a system that does both build and dependency management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dependency manager conflicts with the host system's package manager and might use inferior technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Besides NPM, Apache Maven is also a prominent example&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Node.js developers:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many Node developers are not aware of some of NPM's dependency management implications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good to raise awareness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Package manager developers (e.g. the NPM devs):

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtually every modern programming language/environment has its own (language-specific) package manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lessons learned are important for everybody&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Having spent more than the last decade being the main point of contact for distributions shipping MySQL, then MariaDB Server, it's clear that working with distributions have many challenges. Licensing changes (when MySQL moved the client libraries from LGPL to GPL with a FOSS Exception), ABI changes, speed (or lack thereof) of distribution releases/freezes, supporting the software throughout the lifespan of the distribution, specific bugs due to platforms, and a lot more will be discussed in this talk. Let's not forget the politics. How do we decide "tiers" of importance for distributions? As a bonus, there will be a focus on how much effort it took to "replace" MySQL with MariaDB.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;Benefits: if you're making a distribution, this is the point of view of the upstream package makers. Why are distribution statistics important to us? Do we monitor your bugs system or do you have a better escalation to us? How do we test to make sure things are going well before release. This and more will be spoken about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an upstream project (package), we love nothing more than being available everywhere. But time and energy goes into making this is so as there are quirks in every distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Part of our job as package maintainers in various distributions is to ensure the binary packages can be built from the corresponding source code. This is often a requirement, either from a distribution's own policies (eg, the DFSG for Debian), or from the license of the upstream package (eg, the GPL). But although we are used to seeing .c and .py files as source, we sometimes forget that our packages are built from many other files for which we also must make the source available.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will explain why we require source code in the first place; without the availability of source code, the whole free software ecosystem would not exist. I will also describe file types that we sometimes forget to see as source, or which are considered binary but we forget to include the source code for. This includes documentation, build scripts, files generated at build time by various programs, fonts, multimedia such as sound, music, images and even video. I will also describe various problems we can encounter when trying to determine what the actual source is, and that even if we know what the source is, that it is sometimes creates practical problems for distributions to include all of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Overview of 5G, network slicing, and OpenAirInterface&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting aspects of the 4G/5G era is confluence between the open-source software-defined networking technologies used in mainstream fixed networks and the closed-source technologies used the access and core components of cellular networks. This poses significant challenges from a legal standpoint because of the required mix of the two software technologies in common data centers. This conflictual relationship is aggravated further with the emergence of mobile edge computing. Once the legal issues are ultimately resolved, as it seems to be the case, the main issue will be that of satisfying real-time processing constraints for the radio-access network functions.  These stem from the latency requirements of cellular systems when the radio-access procedures are executed on commodity servers. Moreover, when network function virtualization is put into the picture to allow for techniques such as network slicing to descend down in the radio-access network, the situation becomes even more challenging from a real-time perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide an overview of the evolution of 4G networks towards 5G and some of he new applications and industries that will be enabled by it. We also cover the role of the OpenAirInterface Software Alliance and how it is trying to soften the blow of clash between open and closed-source communities in radio-access and core networks along with its relationship with some of the other related open-source communities.  The talk will also cover some technical aspects related to the difficulties in virtualizing radio-access network functions on commodity servers when it comes to real-time requirements, orchestration and management.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Transport Layer Development Kit (TLDK) is new Layer 4 implementation, developed for DPDK (dpdk.org) and VPP (https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TCP and UDP socket based applications are core technologies in the modern data-center. The introduction of Orchestration, SDN controllers, vSwitches and Virtual Dataplane have seen a huge change in how network packets are delivered to data-centre nodes. While the stacks that consume these packets, the socket based applications have evolved much more slowly. Virtual switches like VPP and OVS-DPDK, have benefited from the vector packet processing technology in DPDK to scale process millions of packets per second, while TCP and UDP socket based applications have not yet benefited. There have been a number recent efforts to port various L4 implementations to DPDK, and while these usually give a modest performance benefit the performance of these is not yet revolutionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDK has been developed from the ground up to be a very fast and scalable UDP and TCP implementation, targeted for use with DPDK and VPP. In this presentation will provide an overview of TLDK design and implementation. This deep-dive will include:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overview of the TLDK UDP and TCP API, and how it differs from the BSD Sockets API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How TLDK scales DOS prevention mechanisms such as SynCookie and SynCache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How TLDK scales TCP Timers to handle millions of connections per core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How TLDK integrates with Virtual Switches likes VPP?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will existing TCP and UDP based applications such as NGINX or Apache Traffic Server benefit from TLDK?&lt;/li&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk demonstrates that programmability and performance does not require user space networking, it can be achieved in the kernel by generating BPF programs and leveraging the existing kernel subsystems. We will demo an early prototype which provides fast IPv6 &amp;amp; IPv4 connectivity to containers, container labels based security policy with avg cost O(1), and debugging and monitoring based on the per-cpu perf ring buffer.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Stateful packet processing with eBPF: an implementation of OpenState interface</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>SDN and NFV</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Software Defined Networks (SDNs) usually involve programmable switches with limited autonomy of decision, that heavily rely on the instructions of their controller to handle “exceptions” and to adapt to traffic evolution. In an attempt to bring back some of the dataplane logic from the controller to the programmable switches, the &lt;a href="https://beba-eu.github.io/"&gt;OpenState&lt;/a&gt; abstraction layer has been designed, to enable efficient stateful packet processing through programmable actions occurring at the switch level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of this talk in an introduction to OpenState and includes a description of the layer as well as some example use cases. Then the implementation prototypes of OpenState realized during the project will be presented. One, in particular, will get more focus: because &lt;a href="https://www.iovisor.org/blog/2016/04/12/exploring-ebpf-io-visor-and-beyond"&gt;eBPF&lt;/a&gt; (extended version of Berkeley Packet Filter) can be stateful and has been conceived to reach high performances for inline packet filtering and processing, we found it to be an excellent target for OpenState.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the background: the work around OpenState (and its extended version, Open Packet Processor) has been achieved in the context of the &lt;a href="http://www.beba-project.eu/"&gt;BEBA&lt;/a&gt; research project (Horizon 2020), that tackles dataplane programmability for SDNs. Started in January 2015 and closing in March 2017, this project has entered its final stage, mostly centered on functional and performance tests for the validation of the developed prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

This session provides a brief intro to Software Defined Networking (SDN) in general, and more specifically to OpenDaylight, an open source platform for programmable SDN. After providing a high level overview of the architecture, the session goes on to show you how to deploy OpenDaylight and interact with it through the CLI and graphical tools. You will learn how to configure various options and enable/disable various features, and how to check the logs to verify things are working as planned and trouble shoot things when they are not. Lastly we show you how to interact with OpenDaylight through its northbound APIs for network aware applications and southbound plugins to physical and virtual network elements.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;NFV and virtualized high performance applications, such as video processing, require a “fast data stack” solution that provides both carrier grade forwarding performance, scalability and open extensibility, along with functionality for realizing application policies and controlling a complex network topology. This session discusses how different components in OpenStack and OpenDaylight are being evolved to integrate with the new open source Virtual Packet Processor (VPP) forwarder provided by the FD.io Linux Foundation project to build such a solution stack. The FastDataStacks is run as an OPNFV project where leverages OPNFV’s continuous integration, deployment and test pipeline as well as the automated component install and test infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the system administration world, Ansible is a well know tool used to deploy and manage systems easily and seamlessly. However, few people know this can also be used by network engineer to manage manage all kind of switches and network equipement thanks to the flexibility of the agent-less design. This in turn open the doors of automation of the network layer without the disruption of a complete SDN solution, permitting to adopt modern best practices of management with small step, and starting the culture change required for embracing SDN.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk will quickly present Ansible, its principles, and how you can use it to manage a simple server. Then we will go deeper in the topic of network, the philosophy behind the network modules, their limitations, and how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The FOSDEM Networking team has managed the network for FOSDEM since its early days. Through our time operating this network, we have learned a few things about keeping networking up for a large group of highly-connected hackers, without an SDN controller managing the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discuss how you can get traffic and monitoring information out of traditional routers and how to program them using NETCONF/YANG.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;opsi is a powerful tool for &lt;em&gt;client management&lt;/em&gt; in heterogenous environments. This lightning talk will give a short overview over the system and what possibilities system administrators get with opsi for managing Windows and Linux clients.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In many environments system administrators are required to manage a wide range of operating systems. Wouldn't it be great to have a tool where one tool can manage Windows and Linux? Introducing opsi, a client management tool that allows managing both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will give you an overview of the system opsi and introduces possible tasks that can be done with opsi.
Handling different systems is most present when writing the scripts that perform tasks on the clients. Similarities and differences that administrators may face when creating these scripts are important for the creation and will be highlighted during that talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Using octocatalog-diff to view catalog changes in the Foreman UI</subtitle>
        <track>Config management</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Viewing the potential changes when changing the environment on a Puppet agent is challenging - much can be altered, and often the only way to know what will change is to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; run it. Using octocatalog-diff (from GitHub) and TheForeman (using a new plugin) we can now view these changes up front, in the UI, &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; switching the agent to the new env&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Octocatalog-diff is a commandline tool to show the differences between two puppet environments for a specific node &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the node is moved to the new env. That's great, but not everyone wants to work on the commandline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we'll look at a new Foreman plugin (foreman-puppetdiff) which brings this functionality to the Foreman UI. We'll cover the basics of octocatalog-diff (installation, uses, limitations) and then show how to set up the Foreman plugin and use it in the UI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Dockerfiles, while being the de factor standard for generating Docker containers, are also often seen as cumbersome to write and maintain due to the nature
of Docker layering, subtle behaviour changes due to caches, and best practices who requires explicit actions to be applied. To improve
this situation while keeping the innovation of Dicker, the Ansible community came with the ansible-container project, a tool that permit to reuse
the existing trove of Ansible roles to create, build and deploy containers in production with a single command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will present the project, explain the basics of ansible-container, show how to use it to build and deploy a complex multi-containers application.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Analysis on advantages of using an external node classifier system.
Examples on how to ease Saltstack administration with reclass.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The configuration management system are born in order to lower the burden of administering a bunch of servers and to increase the profitability of the work of the system administrator. But what happens with the increase of the administered nodes and the extensiveness of the administration's formulas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do not get lost into the complexity of rules and exceptions, the life of the system administration could be eased by the adoption of an external node classifier system that could bring clarity and concision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As example I will show how to easy the administration of a saltstack infrastructure with reclass, a ENC software compatible also with Puppet and Ansible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;If you need to manage more then a reasonably sized infrastructure in today's day and age you will want to automate things as much as possible. In order to do that properly, you'll need to use tools that help you manage your infrastructure. This poses a problem: before you can manage your infrastructure, you now need to manage the infrastructure you will use to manage your infrastructure. The interesting bit is that if you use industry best practices, a lot of that management infra will look the same or similar across organisations. So why do we need to reinvent the weel over and over?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will present OpsTheater, a stack of tools used to manage an infrastructure made up of current industry best practices (Puppet, GitLab, Icinga, ELK stack). OpsTheater is a fully open source project that was started in late 2015 and is growing to be a great set of tools that takes away the work we do over and over: managing the infrastructure to manage our infrastructure.
We will look at the problems OpsTheater solves, the state of the project and what you can do with it today. If you want to help, we'll show where you an go and what you can do. If time permits, a demo will be added showing some of the things we can do with OpsTheater.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Next Generation Config Mgmt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A presentation about a next gen config management tool, and the specific problems this project solves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three of the main design features of the tool include:
* Parallel execution
* Event driven mechanism
* Distributed architecture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will demo a prototype I've built that implements these ideas and which is written in golang.
I will start by presenting an introduction to the tool.
I will then demo the new features that were added since the project was introduced. This will include the automatic grouping, automatic elastic etcd clustering and remote execution features.
I will finally share some of the future planned designs for the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An introductory blog post on the subject is available. https://ttboj.wordpress.com/2016/01/18/next-generation-configuration-mgmt/ Attendees are encouraged to read it before the talk if they are interested!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>How compliance, auditing and vulnerability scanning fit with Config Managment</subtitle>
        <track>Config management</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Config management is a perfect fit for compliance: you model desired compliant state, continually enforce it and have a full audit path of when changes occur and what lead to the drift. But what are the best practises for using config management for compliance, what are the caveats, how do you scan for issues and how can you keep the auditors happy?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you work with or at a Telco, Financial Institution or a Government entity, you probably already know about compliance and the various acronyms and headaches it can bring. How can we make this less of a painful process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if you think about it, compliance is, at its base level, a set of rules that someone has given you to enforce and prove that they're being enforced. What is configuration management? A series of rules for systems that need to be enforced.
So compliance is the perfect use-case for configuration management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll be discussing how you can enforce compliance in your estate with config management, what open-source tooling you to perform scans across your estate, how to save time by leveraging existing work such as http://dev-sec.io.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll also be talking about how to sell the benefits of config management for compliance to stakeholders and some real-life examples of how it's worked with customers in the past, and the caveats that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The leading configuration management tools, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and others, are open source products, so active communities have formed around these technologies. The people participating in this community are one of the things that really stand out. When you ask about the best part of this community, the most common response is “the people,” since they tend to be welcoming, friendly, knowledgeable, and most importantly, helpful. The community certainly isn't perfect, and there are some challenges. This talk will cover a variety of wonderful and not so wonderful things about the configuration management community.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The BSDA certification is designed to be an entry-level certification on BSD Unix systems administration.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Testing candidates with a general Unix background and at least six months of work experience as a BSD systems administrator, or who wish to obtain employment as a BSD systems administrator, will benefit most from this certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The successful BSDA candidate is able to complete common administrative and troubleshooting tasks and has a good understanding of general BSD Unix and networking principles. In addition, the successful candidate demonstrates basic skills with these BSD operating systems: Dragonfly BSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD. This does not mean that the candidate needs to learn the complete details of four operating systems. It does mean that the candidate is aware of the basic utilities common to these operating systems, and where specified in the exam objectives, of features unique to some of the BSD operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The new VDEplug code now supports a URL-like syntax to define the virtual networking system to use.
While it is backward compatible, and it is supported by many VM (kvm/qemu, virtualbox, user-mode linux, umview), now it is possible to add the compatibility layer for current and future virtual networking environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently VDEplug supports: legacy VDE, point-to-point AF_UNIX or UDP, tap, vxlan, vxvde, slirp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the developing phase of the slirp plugin, we have implemented a general purpose slirp library (derived from qemu's slirp implementation).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;VDEplug4 together with new tools for the management of namespaces and capability create a new ecosystem for the support of virtual networking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Live patching -- the process of updating software while it is running -- has become a popular topic of late, with several companies offering services providing live patching for Linux culminating with an implementation being contributed to Linux. While Xen supports live migration of VMs which mitigates the need for live patching, there are still some reasons why live patching is useful. For example, to minimize downtime, when running applications with low latency requirements, and when using PCI passthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk reviews the state of live patching for Xen. A live patching implementation has recently been contributed to Xen so we will look at the design and implementation in detail, noting how and why it differs from live patching for Linux. We will look at some of the ways that live patches can be created and the pitfalls to watch out for when doing so. There will also be a status report of ongoing and future work for live patching for Xen. Finally, the talk will show a demo of live patching in action by building a live patch for a known security issue and applying it to a vulnerable system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Xen LivePatch is a new tech preview feature in Xen 4.7 for live patching the hypervisor. It is the result of collaboration between several members in the community guided by the existing live patching efforts for Linux. We will talk about this and how Xen's requirements differ from Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core idea of Xen LivePatch is to insert a "trampoline" in each buggy function with a jump to a replacement function. This is simple in principle, but there are a number of complexities which make it interesting to look at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live patches can be built by hand, by compiling the replacement functions in a separate source file. This is a manual process and can also be unreliable due to the nature of compiler optimizations. So we repurposed kpatch's live patch creation tool for Xen. This computes a binary difference of the output binaries before and after a source patch is applied. This simplifies the process of creating live patches and overcomes issues with compiler optimizations but is still not without difficulties. We look at the process of creating live patches and why it is hard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The next generation: Certainty in shared storage environments</title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In oVirt datacenter virtualization environments, a manager directs hosts to initiate operations to shared storage.  These operations create or remove volumes, copy data between volumes, create or merge snapshots, and various other actions related to virtual machine storage.  For efficiency and balance these operations should be distributed across multiple hosts and run in parallel when possible.  Maintaining reliability under real world conditions requires careful management and resilient algorithms.  This talk will introduce some of the problems that can arise including: dropped communications, scheduling conflicts, and host or storage array failure.  Next, a solution to these problems using shared storage locking, atomic operations, volume generations, and forensic analysis of the storage will be presented.  Through step by step examples, the audience will understand how the proposed solution can solve all of the outlined problems.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How do you integrate containers in your IaaS? In a VM based IaaS environment, introducing containers can be a painful experience. Most likely you end up running containers inside VMs to reuse existing infrastructure, or you start dividing your data-center into a container- and a VM-world. Either way, you have two management solutions and non optimal resource management. But what if we put VMs inside containers? Would such a copernican revolution give us some benefits? This talk covers our research around using Kubernetes as a virtual machines cluster manager.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you integrate containers in your IaaS? In a VM based IaaS environment, introducing containers can be a painful experience.

Either way, you have two management solutions and non optimal resource management. But what if we put VMs inside containers? Would such a copernican revolution give us some benefits? This talk covers our research around using Kubernetes as a virtual machines cluster manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we will briefly look into what a typical container and a typical VM is. Then we will look into the details on how resource and device limitations are enforced on VMs. In our research we used oVirt, so comparing its host side stack (VDSM/libvirt/QEMU/systemd) to Kubernetes container host side stack (kubelet/docker/rkt/systemd/cni). At the end we will have a better understanding of the differences and overlaps, and can therefore consider how to manage Pet-VMs and containers in the same cluster, managed by kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;QEMU is an open source machine emulator and virtualizer written in C. Over time it has evolved multiple interfaces to interact with the outside world, and multiple internal APIs and abstractions to model and keep track of data. The talk will be a review of some of the challenges and trade-offs involved in making those abstractions work together.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over time, QEMU has evolved multiple interfaces to interact with the outside world (command-line interface, configuration files, its monitor protocol), and multiple internal APIs and abstractions to model and keep track of data (including configuration, device hierarchy, device state, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the goals and limitations of each of those abstractions and finding their way through the long list of acronyms (qdev, QOM, QAPI, QMP, VMState, QemuOpts, QObject, etc) can be intimidating to developers not familiar to QEMU. Sometimes each of them have conflicting world views, different goals and constraints, and interaction between them generate interesting challenges to developers working on QEMU. The talk will be a review of some of the challenges and trade-offs involved in making those abstractions work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The target audience are developers that want to get more familiar with QEMU internal APIs, or see what are the lessons learned (or not learned) from them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will describe the NBD protocol: what is it, what can it do, and why is it relevant for virtualization and IaaS. We will also touch at a few features that have been specified for the protocol, but so far have not been implemented in any known implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Network Block Device (NBD) was originally written for the Linux kernel, to use and export block devices over a network (TCP) link. Its feature set was very limited, however, which limited its practical usability for many purposes. Over the years, however, the protocol has evolved, with features such as better negotiation, improved reliability through flush requests, and awareness of holes in backing files being implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent versions of QEMU implement the client side of the protocol, while at the same time also being able to export local resources through NBD. This situation makes it possible for NBD to be used as a protocol for shared storage, backup, or mirroring of resources to other systems for live migration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will quickly cover the history of the protocol, describing some of the features that were added over the years; make a short comparison against similar protocols such as iSCSI and AoE and why NBD is relevant in that context; and then move on to newer features that were added  to the protocol at the request of the QEMU developers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Unikernels are often touted as being the building blocks of next generation of cloud infrastructure. However, even the process of compiling and booting them remains daunting for the average developer let alone building out infrastructure for them to live on. In this talk we'll dive deep into the various layers of infrastructure one needs to understand in order to build out their own infrastructure for unikernels. What might seem simple at first quickly becomes difficult as one needs to cast aside preconceived notions of what an operating system and application are and how they might interact together. We'll approach everything from hypervisor orchestration to filesystems, networking and best practices for CI and testing. The attendee should be comfortable exploring unikernel cloud concepts by the end of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Lago is an ad-hoc virtual framework which helps you build virtualized environments on your server or laptop for various use cases. It creates and orchestrates virtual machines that can be used to run test suites and allow a developer to quickly test his code change on non-trivial flows such as live migration even before starting the CI process. In this session, we will walk through the usage of Lago in the oVirt project and how it can be extended to assist virtualization developers.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Virtualization software became a vital part of the IT infrastructure of most companies nowadays. Making sure that the software works as expected in "real world" tasks is hard, mainly because virtualization environments are usually hard to reproduce automatically. Lago is an ad-hoc virtual framework which helps you build virtualized datacenter on your server or laptop to run test suites. Being a framework, it can be extended to implement any required workflows needed by the tested software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will discuss how Lago works with KVM and Libvirt to create a test environment, how it can be extended to help with automated system tests of virtualization products and how it is currently used by oVirt project to run automated system tests and help developers testing their patches during development phase. We will also review and compare Lago with tools like Vagrant, when applied to the virtualization development workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Affinity rules in a virtual cluster</subtitle>
        <track>Virtualisation and IaaS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The workloads and scenarios for virtual machines grow more complex every year. So do the interactions, availability, and performance requirements. All that requires the administrators to carefully plan where to start the VMs that depend on each other and/or specific hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will present the concepts that allow the administrator to express the rules for affinity between virtual machines and between virtual machines and hosts to form complex relationships that will cover for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;licensing rules - limiting group of VMs to only use certain hosts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;overhead - web + database VMs running together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;performance - eg. storage VMs running on hosts with better IO performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;failover recovery - VMs returning to “their” hosts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reservation - There is place for only one of us!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;oVirt is an open source project for managing virtual data centers that will now help the administrator with exactly the above tasks. We have introduced the virtual machine affinity feature in the past and a huge improvement in that area is coming right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the best part is that all this works in a fully dynamic environment with automatic conflict resolution and no manual management of host pinning rules, saving the administrator his precious time.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Using NVDIMM under KVM</title>
        <subtitle>Applications of persistent memory in virtualization</subtitle>
        <track>Virtualisation and IaaS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The introduction of non-volatile memory changes how applications, databases,
and virtual machines will work in the future.  NVDIMM is not simply a faster
block device.  Programs can avoid block I/O entirely and use byte-addressable
NVDIMM to benefit from the performance characteristics of RAM.  This requires
new storage APIs that applications must use instead of traditional block I/O.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new programs run successfully inside KVM virtual machines thanks to the
vNVDIMM support already available in QEMU.  Virtualization offers additional
options for managing and using NVDIMM beyond what is available on bare metal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk covers the NVDIMM programming model and how KVM virtual machines can
use NVDIMM for faster I/O, reduced memory footprint, and faster boot times.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Xiao Guangrong recently gave a talk at KVM Forum covering the ACPI and hardware
interface for NVDIMM under KVM.  I want to follow that up with a talk for a
wider audience of developers and system administrators who care more about the
use of NVDIMM than its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk covers recent work on NVDIMM in QEMU and focuses on how applications
can take advantage of this new class of storage device.  It is suitable for an
audience interested in storage or virtualization.  Most of the concepts carry
over to other hypervisors besides KVM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Towards a HVM-like Dom0 for Xen</title>
        <subtitle>reducing the OS burden while taking advantage of new hardware features</subtitle>
        <track>Virtualisation and IaaS</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Xen is a hypervisor using a microkernel design that allows running multiple concurrent operating systems on the same hardware. One of the key features of Xen is that it is OS agnostic, meaning that any OS (with proper support) can be used as a host. Xen has a long history going back to the 90s when it was designed and the early 2000s when it was released. As a consequence of this, many of the assumptions and virtualization techniques backed into it are now superseeded by new hardware features, that make virtualization more transparent from an OS point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk provides an overview on the different kind of guests supported by Xen and how these new hardware features are used in order to improve and evolve them. It also describes the design and implementation of a new guest type, called PVHv2, and how it can be used as a control domain (Dom0).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Google’s chromebooks and routers use off the shelf Microcontrollers (MCU) to do power sequencing, fan control, PWM and other hardware control tasks one typically encounters in embedded systems. Interestingly enough the firmware is available under (3 clause) BSD license and thus open for hacking, abusing and modifying to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll look at a bunch of MCU options and eval boards to get started with, their availability and pricing in low quantities as well as ways to hook them up to your embedded platform. Moreover we’ll look at hardware level requirements your SoC / board will have to provide in order to make it all work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll cover existing driver / software support in upstream Linux and U-Boot, as well as parts that are or were missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical tasks of an embedded controller for a chromebook or random other devices like mine - which is everything but a laptop - will be discussed. Topics covered will include boot selection, firmware upgrades, watchdog timers and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I’ll share my experiences building a real world Zynq based system using chromium-ec on an STM32 MCU and my experiences adapting the software to my needs and interacting with the community.
Examples include replacing the coreboot bootflow with U-Boot, creating device drivers for things like buttons and issues encountered in making things work.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A number of new components have matured in GENIVI to provide a true connected car experience. A couple of them are key connectivity components; namely SOTA (Software Over the Air) and RVI (Remote Vehicle Interface). This talk will discuss both these components, how they work together, the security work done on them and their integration into the GENIVI Development Platform.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will also run down the overall status of GENIVI's development platform and how it can enable an automotive stack to speak not just with the cloud, but with IoT devices via Iotivity interface. The new GENIVI Development Platform (GDP) technical lead, Zeeshan Ali, will give the talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This presentation will provide guidelines how to create an open source hardware add-on board for the most popular single board computer Raspberry Pi using free and open source tools from scratch. Specifications of Raspberry Pi Foundation for HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) will be revealed in details. Leon Anavi has been developing an open source Raspberry Pi HAT for IoT for more than a year and now he will share his experience, including the common mistakes for a software engineer getting involved in hardware design and manufacturing.
The presentation is appropriate for anyone interested in building entirely open source products that feature open source hardware and open source software. No previous experience or hardware knowledge is required. The main audience are developers, hobbyists, makers, and students. Hopefully the presentation will encourage them to grab a soldering iron and start prototyping their DIY open source device.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pi is the most popular single board computer among hobbyists and students. In 2014 Raspberry Pi Foundation released a specification for add-on boards called HAT (Hardware Attached on Top). Nowadays we are capable of making our own open source add boards following these specifications.
In this presentation, Leon Anavi will share his experience in designing an open source hardware Raspberry Pi HAT and developing open source software for it using only free and open source tools such as KiCAD. Leon has been working on his Raspberry Pi HAT as a hobby project in his spare time for more than a year. In November 2016 his open source Raspberry Pi was successfully crowdfunded through IndieGoGo. Now he will explain the challenges and the common mistakes for a software engineer getting involved in hardware design and manufacturing. The presentation will reveal details about the technical  specifications of Raspberry Pi HAT, the life cycle of entirely open source project and will provide getting started guidelines.
The presentation is appropriate for anyone interested in open source hardware and open source software development. Previous experience or knowledge about hardware design is NOT required. Attendees can expect details about Raspberry Pi HAT technical specification, embedded Linux software development tips for Raspberry Pi, guidelines for hardware design and low cost manufacturing of prototypes or small volume PCB.
This presentation will help software developers, hobbyists and students better understand the value of open source hardware and hopefully it will encourage them to a get a soldering iron and start prototyping add-on boards for their favorite Raspberry Pi. The presentation will be also useful to people interested in the concept of entirely open source projects that integrate open source hardware and software created with free and open source tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the major challenges for certification in the SIL2LinuxMP project, is to
show that Linux does not only define a development process, but also follows
it. To this end (and far beyond!) the meta-data of commits to the Linux kernel
are analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk covers everything from gathering the data, to distributing it to every
one in the project while keeping it the data up-to-date and of course our first
analysis results. Each of these phases contain their own set of problems that
needed to be considered, leading to a framework called DLCDM (Development
Life-Cylce Data-Mining) that is introduced for the first time during this talk.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

show that Linux does not only define a development process, but also follows
it. To this end (and far beyond!) the meta-data of commits to the Linux kernel
are analyzed. There are several intended outputs we hope to get out of this
analysis, some examples are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    - Competence of persons involved (IEC 61508-1, 6.2.13/6.2.14)
    - Dependencies amongst developers (Independence of persons doing code
      reviews)
    - Identify patches that did not get enough review (based on patch
      complexity, experience of author, reviews, etc.)
    - Automatic notification of patches in our configuration
    - Bug analysis (based on Fixes: tag)
    - Subsystem dependencies and conflicts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Serial Peripheral Interconnect (SPI) bus is a ubiquitous de facto standard found in many embedded systems produced today. The Linux kernel has long supported this bus via a comprehensive framework which supports both SPI master and slave devices. The session will explore the abstractions that the framework provides to expose this hardware to both kernel and userspace clients. The talk will cover which classes of hardware supported and use cases outside the scope of the subsystem today. In addition, we will discuss subtle features of the SPI subsystem that may be used to satisfy hardware and performance requirements in an embedded Linux system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Building products requires putting together many components. There are source-based distributions supporting that process. Using a pre-built, pre-tested binary distribution like Debian has its advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isar is a system for image generation using binary packages. It uses mainstream tools and workflows to build multiple products, managing common subsystems, and maintaining components from different vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Baurzhan will describe the motivation for Isar, its current state, advantages and challenges to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Software updates with OSTree</title>
        <subtitle>Why and how</subtitle>
        <track>Embedded, mobile and automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Security reasons and market demands dictate that software in a connected embedded Linux device should be updated regularly. Update on a package basis that is used by PC Linux distributions can be a security threat by itself on embedded devices. On the other hand, full fylesystem upgrade that is common in embedded field can be too wasteful for systems constrained in network bandwith and disk space. OSTree is a tool that allows for upgrades that are both incremental and atomic and as such perfectly fits the needs of embedded world.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Software updating is an essential feature for a connected embedded Linux device, even if it is not required by end users of the device, since responce to newly discovered vulnerabilities in critical Linux software should be as fast as possible.
One approach that is widely used in Linux world is using a package manager that will download a package and take care of all the dependencies. Unfortunately, some dependencies and/or conflicts with other packages can not be noticed by repository mantainers. On a PC it would just lead to the necessity to revert the package back to the working version, but on an embedded device with no human operator it is not possible. Theoretically, number of system configurations is an exponent of number of packages one can install, which means that it is practically impossible to make sure that no combination will result in a broken system.
In embedded world it is more common to update whole file system image atomically. Thus we can test system configuration before we distribute it to the devices. To allow for atomic switching between file tree versions, dual disk partitioning scheme is used: while Linux is running on a root file system stored in one partition, updates are written to another. When the whole new file system image is downloaded, Linux can switch atomically to it. The main drawback of this approach is that you actually have to download the whole file tree (which can be 100-800MB large in modern devices) for every update. You also can use only half of your available disk space at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSTree was developed by GNOME team for the GNOME Continuous project and was not initialy intended to be used in embedded Linux. It stores all the data in a git-like object repository, but unlike git it is designed to store binary data and can deploy data as hardlinks to the objects in the repository, thus saving significant amount of disk space. Like git it allows to incrementally transfer data between repositories, thus making distribution of software updates possible.
OSTree repository contains roughly three kinds of objects: commit, directory and file object. Every commit points to a directory tree and represents a version of file system tree. Commits can then be deployed to a dedicated area and the system can switch to a deployed file tree much the same way it would switch to another partition in dual-partition scheme. Since deploying files just creates hard links to the file objects in the repository, there is no data duplication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These benefits come at a price: since deployed files are just hardlinks to objects in a repository, they can't be changed, as it would corrupt the repository and other deployed file systems. Therefore, a clear separation should be mantained between read-only data, such as executables and resources and writable data, such as temporary files, logs, configuration stored in /etc. These requirements are not too restrictive, for most use-cases it will just involve putting data in correct directories.
An image class that thansforms an OSTree-ignorant file tree to appropriate form and BSP packages for some popular platforms (Raspberry Pi, Porter board, QEMU; minnowboard coming soon) were integrated into Yocto build process and are now available as a separate Yocto layer on Github [https://github.com/advancedtelematic/meta-updater]. It allows you to create OSTree-enabled image and a commit in your OSTree repository as a part of your normal build process (simply 'bitbake your_image').&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There is no de facto secured embedded Linux distro while the requirement is becoming more and more critical with raise of IoT in Industrial domains.
When looking under the hood of the Yocto built AGL project, it is obvious that it can fit 95% of the most common requirements as a Secured Embedded Linux.
We will look how non Automotive industries can easily reuse the AGL code and tools to build their own industrial product and why it's a safer bet than to build it internally.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Industrial IoT cannot be successful without a serious improvement of the security coverage. Unfortunately there is as today, no of-the-shelves offer and the skills required to create such solution, are at best rare, more often out of reach.
AGL as created a customizable embedded Linux distro which is nicely designed for reuse in many domains outside of Automotive. During the presentation we will see how to:
 - start your development with boards readily available on the Net,
 - change the BSP and add peripherial using Yocto layers or project like MRAA,
 - integrate a secure boot in your platform,
 - add your middleware and your application without breaking the maintained Core OS
 - develop a UI on the integrated screen and/or an HTML remote brower
 - update the core OS and your add-ons.
 - get support and influence the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 2016 Mozilla did a qualitative exploration project into the experiences and motivations of community members from several different open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results have been crucial in understanding what we are doing well, not so well and what others are doing better. The results also highlighted the need to not treat every new member in a similar way and highlighted the need for diverse recruitment methods and on boarding experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The presentation will go through the identified motivations and experiences as well as present the 4 persona's that were developed and how to use the research moving forward in your own community work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Join us as we demonstrate how Mozilla are using Selenium to test Firefox by extending the WebDriver specification.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Selenium is a popular tool for testing websites across multiple browsers, and when combined with Mozilla's implementation of the WebDriver specification, it becomes possible to interact directly with Firefox itself. In this session, we'll show a simple approach to writing tests using Selenium in Python, and then demonstrate how we're taking this further to replace our existing functional UI tests for Firefox. By using Selenium, we're hoping to make contributing to these tests much easier for our community, and by pushing the tools to their limits we'll also make them rock solid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>How Rust is being developed</title>
        <subtitle>The Rust development dashboard</subtitle>
        <track>Mozilla</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Rust project has become a large software development project. To better understand how it is being developed, a software development analytics dashboard has been deployed for it. This dashboard tracks most of the public data about Rust development, and allows to visualize, drill down and understand that data. The talk will present this dashboard, and how to use it to learn about the details of Rust development processes and community. It will also present some interesting data obtained from it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Rust software development dashboard visualizes data obtained from some systems used to support Rust development: git, GitHub, StackOverflow... The data related to Rust is retrieved from them, stored, organized an massaged in a database, and later visualized in the dashboard. The dashboard allows not only to browse the data, but also to drill down and play with it. This way, any person interested in how Rust is being developed can have both an general overview, or very detailed views of the community and processes involved. The dashboard permits to track activity (in commits, issues, pull requests, questions and answers, etc.), actors (who is creating the code, who is fixing bugs, who is answering questions), and processes (hot long does it take to close issues, or to accept pull requests).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rust Development Dashbard has been deployed using GriomoireLab, an complete FOSS system for retrieving data from software development repositories, storing it, and producing different kinds of analytics, dashboards and reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will present the different kind of information that can be obtained from the dashboard, and how to interact with it for finding any detail of interest. Several specific aspects of Rust development will be presented as well, so that people attending may expect to finish the talk with a better understanding of how Rust is being developed. The talk will also provide hints on how to exploit the data behind the dashboard to obtain specific information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;C has been the &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; systems programming language for decades, so huge amounts of useful programs and libraries are written in that language. New Rust code can make use of that legacy of work via FFI, but to get the full advantages of Rust, legacy software needs to be re-written in Rust. Corrode is a tool to semi-automate these rewrites by producing Rust source that behaves exactly like the original C, enabling developers to focus on the interesting parts of improving code quality. I'll talk about what Corrode does and does not do; present case studies of Corrode-assisted translations; and discuss rationale for decisions such as writing Corrode in Haskell or documenting in "literate programming" style.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Mozilla's SpiderMonkey library can be used to embed JavaScript in any C++ projects. It is quite easy to expose some simple bindings and get a "hello world" application running in no-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after this first hello world, you'll quickly notice that you'll need other features such as timer, networking, file access, threading or even graphics and audio. At this point things get much more complicated, and maintaning the bindings can quickly become overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team has been creating such bindings for SpiderMonkey since 2007 in several projects and this talk will present best practices, tips and caveats that we have learned over the years. We will also see how to make embedders life easier by using nidium library that bundles many basic bindings, in the hope that more developers can use the power of SpiderMonkey in a convienient way.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Learning to code might be the handiest skill of the XXI. century - but finding motivation to do so seems to be the hardest part. Even when one decides to embark on this journey, their path is often hindered by the lack or quality of tools, resources they will be using, and are often turned away by the lack of success and their feeling of "coding is not for me" is often reinforced by all these negative experiences.
This is where Happy Code Friends, Code Invaders and Clouduboy tries to help - introduce coding, hardware and IoT in a friendly, impulse-rich, exciting environment to anyone willing to give computers a try.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

This is where Happy Code Friends, Code Invaders and Clouduboy tries to help - introduce coding, hardware and IoT in a friendly, impulse-rich, exciting environment to anyone willing to give computers a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Code Friends is a "free one-day coding bootcamp" type of initiative to introduce anyone to web technologies and coding in general, with the intention to give them a taste of the bright side of computer programming, and start them on a way of learning coding self-sufficiently. Code Invaders is a free online webpage/tutorial teaching basic JavaScript programming concepts by building an online game. Clouduboy is a free web-based tool for creating HTML5 games with JavaScript and running/playing them on tiny microcontrollers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many developers do not consider web standards while create their webpages/apps. This will create a bad experience for some users that not use that product with a certain OS or application.
This talk will cover best practices and give examples of how some users could not do some simple booking because of the bad experience given by the website for their app.
This will cover web in general, not only Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many developers do not consider web standards while create their webpages/apps. This will create a bad experience for some users that not use that product with a certain OS or application. And nowdays there are way to many configuration available to be sure you use the right one. And a limited memory will narrow your option to have several apps installed only for certain webpages.
Some simple example for a bike sharing system, a Michelin rated restaurant from Stockholm or a museum in Krakow - that worked poorly on several browsers will show the importance of compatibility.
Best practices for developers will be presented.
Best practices for report issues will be exemplified.
Already fixed issue will present simple solutions to the audience that unblocked several users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A look at how HTTP/2 has improved the web, which cases that are still
problematic and what's being done about it. Will there be a QUIC fix?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A shorter recap on what HTTP/2 brought that HTTP/1 couldn't offer before we
dig in and look at some numbers that show how HTTP/2 has improved (browser)
networking and the web experience for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are scenarios where HTTP/1's multiple connections win over HTTP/2
in performance tests. Why is that and what is being done about it? Wasn't
HTTP/2 supposed to be the silver bullet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A closer look at QUIC, its promises to fix the areas where HTTP/2 didn't
deliver and a check on where it is today. Is QUIC perhaps actually HTTP/3 in
everything but the name?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Depending on what exactly happens in this area over time until FOSDEM, I will
spice it up with more details on how we work on these protocol things in
Mozilla/Firefox.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With Mozilla shutting down its Persona web login service in late 2016, a pretty decent solution for logging into small websites became unavailable. The problem that Persona set out to solve is not gone, we still need solutions to log into all kinds of sites without a few central and big players analyzing all data about when and where we log in.
I ran into that issue for my sites &lt;a href="https://home.kairo.at/blog/2016-10/the_neverending_question_of_login_system"&gt;as documented in my blog&lt;/a&gt; - this talk will discuss the problem itself and my solution to it. This may include opening up some source code to the public!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>Developing a deeper understanding of minorities in tech.</subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Diversity User Research: Becoming a Better Listener - Gloria Dwomoh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to understand the struggles and/or challenges of minorities in tech and foster a safe environment for their inclusion, we need to be better listeners. One way we are able to get access to the voice of our users is through user research. However in order to increase effective communication we need to learn the art of listening. Several of us were taught to speak, read and write, but we simply assume we know how to listen. There is a saying that less than 2% of people have had any formal education on how to listen, while that is a skill that many of us use in our daily lives. Through this talk we will understand the difference between hearing and listening; we will also explore active listening and how it can better help us in our user research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women in Open Source Technologies - Kristi Progri&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gender Gap is one of the most talked topic since forever, and still a Gap. Where are the women in Open Source? Why is the gap so big? Women participation in open technology and culture is very important so we should all pay more attention. This talk will be focused on the large steps we can take to reduce this gap. Also we will share out experience at our hackerspace in Tirana, Albania since we have lots of women there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's face it: Gender Diversity in Tech is in a quite bad shape. The sad thing about it is that it's even more noticeable in many Open Source communities in particular. But why is gender diversity important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just diversity for the sake of diversity. If men and women are equally intelligent, statistically speaking, then out of the smartest ten people in the world, five should be male and five should be female. Thus, if your team is anything less than an equal balance of men and women, then your team is probably not the best it can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, if we take a look at a random sample from GitHub active contributors from 2015, just 5.4% of GitHub users with over 10 contributions are female.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about the ways we can fix this and what efforts Mozilla does to improve this and how you can help Mozilla help the community, concretely with Womoz (Women at Mozilla) and the Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion Team at Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;After nearly a decade, the European Commission has presented its draft law for copyright reform. And it’s about time: our copyright laws are out of step with today’s technology. But the proposal to reform copyright lacks ambition, and is inadequate to address the today’s challenges. It even contains some very dangerous provisions - such as a snippet tax, and upload filters for online platforms - that would put the open internet, innovation, and creativity, at great risk. This session will unpack some of the key issues at stake in the reform and how you can get involved. Together we can achieve an EU copyright reform that fosters innovation and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Portfolio of optimized cryptographic functions based on Keccak</title>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since its adoption as the SHA-3 standard, Keccak has grown out of the mere hashing functionality. We present a consistent set of cryptographic functions, for fast hashing, pseudo-random bit generation, authentication or authenticated encryption, that enjoy very competitive safety margin vs speed ratios. We highlight the bases for the security of these functions and dive into their software implementations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Beyond the FIPS 202 standard functions derived from Keccak (i.e., SHA-3 hash functions and SHAKE{128,256} extendable output functions), we present several interesting proposals, consistently based on the same permutation or its round function. Among others:
* For authenticated encryption, Ketje and Keyak are schemes that were selected for the third round of the CAESAR competition. In particular, Keyak proposes interesting features when protecting a stream of data flowing on a network. It exploits the parallelism in modern processors to achieve a high throughput.
* KangarooTwelve is a recently published arbitrary-output-length hash function. We designed it so that the implementation can automatically adapt to the available degree of parallelism. On Intel's Haswell and Skylake architectures, it achieves a speed below 1.5 cycles/byte for long inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two key aspects will be covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the essential goal of these functions is to remain secure despite advances in cryptanalysis. We will explain explain how we base the security on two strong pillars: the track record of third-party cryptanalysis and the generic security of the underlying construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, we will explore the Keccak Code Package and its two-level structure. The high-level cryptographic services are implemented in plain C, without any specific optimizations. The low-level services implement the permutations and the state input/output functions, for which we provide optimized code for different platforms. Another interesting topic to discuss is how the parallelism is exploited on modern processors with SIMD units.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The Making of a Secure Open Source Password Keeper</title>
        <subtitle>From the Electronics to the High Level Software...</subtitle>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Mooltipass Offline Password Keeper project was started three years ago by a small community to provide a safe and offline way of storing credentials.
Since then about 50 individuals from around the globe have contributed to the project, bringing two models of the Mooltipass device to market.
This talk will describe the Mooltipass hardware, firmware and software architectures with a focus on what it took to move from idea to commercial product while having all the development and production files publicly available on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A writer for Hackaday at the time, in December 2013 project creator Mathieu Stephan had the crazy idea of creating an open hardware device using a team spread all over the globe. He made a call for developers on hackaday.com which resulted in the formation of a team of 20 individuals. Over the course of three years, using a variety of free (Trello, Google groups, IRC) and open source (KiCad, Gimp, GCC) tools the Mooltipass team developed a complete solution composed of:
- Firmware for the devices (AES encryption, storage management, graphics, random number generation, smartcard management)
- Two models of physical device each composed of a PCB, case, screen, usb and smartcard connectors
- Several software solutions to provide computer integration with the device, depending on the users' preferences: a cross platform daemon (Windows, Linux, Mac) [moolticute], a python management tool [mooltipy], a chrome and firefox extension, a chrome app to provide native integration with websites (all open source)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a complete team not remunerated and working on the Mooltipass project during their spare time created interesting management challenges, particularly regarding establishing and enforcing coding rules and commenting practices. The first crowdfunding campaign successfully raised $125k in December 2014, which is all funding needed to start snowballing from there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>It's time to SAFE the Internet</title>
        <subtitle>Introducing SAFE, the decentralised privacy-first storage and communication network</subtitle>
        <track>Security and Encryption</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Servers are hacked. Passwords leaked. Personal information stolen. DNS DDoS'ed. Cloud services are mining and exploiting everything they can get their hands on. The core problem; centralised server infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will introduce you to SAFE, a decentralised privacy-first open source data storage and communications network enabling anyone to develop decentralised, secure, privacy-concealing apps.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no more denying it; the server-centric infrastructure has failed us: personal information mined, private photos are stolen, passwords leaked, entire infrastructures DDoS'ed – en masse. We are doomed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But are we? Actually, as engineers, we know better: a decentralised network has the highest reliability. With distributed computing resources that can scale up and down on-demand and aren't bound by physical limitations. And we've been building these systems, clusters of databases across data centres, successfully for years – in our server backends. On the public internet, however, we are still using a single point of failure infrastructures: DNS, single endpoint IPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But issues with the existing Internet infrastructure don't stop there: government firewalls can block web services for entire countries, our plain text communication is heavily surveilled, and companies mine our most personal and private data for their profit. To protect one's privacy, people have to resort to obfuscation protocols like Tor – with significant drawbacks like slower connectivity and worsened user experience. But even then the data is still stored, exploited and stolen from the centralised "cloud providers".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is time that we bring those concepts of distributed computing, decentralised storage and communication out of the data centres into the realm of the wider internet. Combine that with an obfuscating peer-2-peer routing mechanism, a transparent, self-encrypting public-key-infrastructure and automatic data retention, and you have covered the basics of what the open source SAFE Network software provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we explore the SAFE Network, the underlying DHT-based routing, and the XOR-namespace and how they are used to successfully conceals connectivity and even metadata itself by making it infeasible for an attacker to calculate the path data will travel. We will discover what it means to build privacy-first Apps on a network where all data is sandboxed per tenant and distributed over multiple machines. Furthermore, by taking a look at the APIs SAFE provides and going through some example apps, we will learn how to structure and build fully distributed, privacy-first Apps on SAFE today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will take a look into the future of SAFE, what apps are in development and how developers could alternatively be paid through the built-in currency based on the app usage rather than the exploitation of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAFE, Secure Access for Everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk covers an alternative to key escrows using new cryptographic techniques implemented by the Clevis (client) and Tang (server) projects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Keeping secrets is tough. It is hard enough when you have control over the full computing chain. But now we are expected to keep secrets while storing those secrets in cloud and SaaS infrastructures. At least we can trust the network providers, right? Of course, the answer is to encrypt the data. But then how do we know who should have access to the data and when? This talk will look at the new strategies and cryptographic techniques implemented by the Tang and Clevis open source projects. Tang forgoes complex (and compromise-prone) key management infrastructures by using simple algorithms to bind data to third party entities. Clevis permits sophisticated unlocking policies that go beyond simply password management to true attributed cryptography. Come see how to integrate Tang and Clevis into your infrastructure or software project!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>WireGuard: Next Generation Secure Kernel Network Tunnel</title>
        <subtitle>Cutting edge crypto, shrewd kernel design, and networking meet in a surprisingly simple combination</subtitle>
        <track>Security and Encryption</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;WireGuard is a next generation VPN protocol, which lives in the Linux kernel, and uses state of the art cryptography. One of the most exciting recent crypto-networking developments, WireGuard aims to drastically simplify secure tunneling. The current state of VPN protocols is not pretty, with popular options, such as IPsec and OpenVPN, being overwhelmingly complex, with large attack surfaces, using mostly cryptographic designs from the 90s. WireGuard presents a new abuse-resistant and high-performance alternative based on modern cryptography, with a focus on implementation and usability simplicity. It uses a 1-RTT handshake, based on NoiseIK, to provide perfect forward secrecy, identity hiding, and resistance to key-compromise impersonation attacks, among other important security properties, as well as high performance transport using ChaCha20Poly1305. A novel IP-binding cookie MAC mechanism is used to prevent against several forms of common denial-of-service attacks, both against the client and server, improving greatly on those of DTLS and IKEv2. Key distribution is handled out-of-band with extremely short Curve25519 points, which can be passed around in the likes of OpenSSH. Discarding the academic layering perfection of IPsec, WireGuard introduces the idea of a "cryptokey routing table", alongside an extremely simple and fully defined timer-state mechanism, to allow for easy and minimal configuration; WireGuard is actually securely deployable in practical settings. In order to rival the performance of IPsec, WireGuard is implemented inside the Linux kernel, but unlike IPsec, it is implemented in less than 4,000 lines of code, making the implementation manageably auditable. These features converge to create an open source VPN utility that is exceedingly simple, yet thoroughly modern and secure.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The presentation will be divided up into several parts. First, there will be an overview of the problems with IPsec, OpenVPN, and other popular VPNs, outlining attacks and weaknesses. Next, the WireGuard idea of the "cryptokey routing table" will be introduced, and we’ll walk through several properties derived from it. This will transition into a discussion of the timer state mechanism, and how secure protocols are necessarily stateful, but it’s possible to make them appear stateless to the user by exhaustively defining all possible state transitions. Then we’ll get into the hardcore meat of the presentation: the cryptography and various crypto innovations behind WireGuard. We will discuss the triple Diffie-Hellman, the role of combining static and ephemeral keys, the performance and DoS-potential of Curve25519 point multiplication, using a PRF chaining for rotating keys, identity hiding and remaining silent on a network, and clever usage of authenticated encryption with additional data. We will examine the various attack models, and enumerate the cryptographic mitigations employed by WireGuard. The sum will be a comprehensive overview of modern day crypto tricks, attacks, and useful constructions, and how these insights have been funneled into WireGuard. Finally, we’ll examine the Linux kernel implementation of WireGuard, seeing how it’s possible to avoid allocations in response to unauthenticated packets as a defense coding technique. During the presentation, a live WireGuard endpoint will be provided to audience members who wish to send packets, whether encrypted, legitimate, malformed, dubious, or otherwise curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Threaded throughout will be an enumeration of attacks on existing protocols and cryptographic tricks for their mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My background is in security -- kernels, hardware, reversing, crypto, large networks, etc -- and as such I've broken a lot of systems with some novel tricks and protocol insights. WireGuard is motivated by a sort of cornucopia of clever attacks (crypto and otherwise) against other networks. I made it because I wanted something I could actually confidently run on my own infrastructure, and none of the other tools were nearly up to the task. So, this talk is going to go into depth about real attacks on various protocols, in addition to unveiling some techniques to avoid entire classes of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, since WireGuard is initially implemented for the Linux kernel, there have been some very interesting considerations to account for with kernel programming. Cross platform implementations are also in the works, written in Go and Rust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Encrypting Matrix</title>
        <subtitle>Building a universal end-to-end encrypted communication ecosystem with Matrix and Olm</subtitle>
        <track>Security and Encryption</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For the last 2 years the Matrix.org team has been working on libolm - a clean-room FOSS liberal-licensed (Apache) independent specification and implementation of the end-to-end encryption Double Ratchet Algorithm as popularised by Signal, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Google Allo etc.  As of November 2016 the spec and library is finally finished and being unleashed on the world, successfully audited by NCC Group, and is available as part of Matrix's client SDKs for Web, iOS &amp;amp; Android and apps that use them (e.g. Riot.im).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will discuss Matrix's mission to be an open, global end-to-end-encrypted communications network - showing that it's possible to build open communication infrastructure which is both secure &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; decentralised (unlike the silos of Signal, Wire, etc); where users can own their data and pick who they trust to run their service.  We'll show how you can use Matrix to securely defragment communities scattered over proprietary silos such as Slack, Telegram and Gitter, open silos like Rocket.Chat and MatterMost - whilst also bridging to IRC, XMPP and even SIP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll also introduce the Megolm cryptographic ratchet - a new ratchet written by Matrix to tackle the specific problem of encrypting Matrix rooms, which may have thousands of users and require synchronised history over multiple devices (including new devices).  Megolm is layered on top of the Olm ratchet, and is unusual in that it encrypts per-device rather than per-user, and lets rooms specify how much scrollback may be decrypted by new devices: providing a customisable trade-off between privacy and usability.  This is a major step forwards from other systems which unilaterally prioritise privacy over usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll give a quick tour of all the FOSS clients, bots and bridges that the community has built on Matrix over the last year - ranging from native Qt clients (Quaternion, NaChat, Tensor), CLI apps (WeeChat), React webapps (Riot, Freebird) to Native mobile apps (Riot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matrix.org is a non-profit open source initiative dedicated to creating and maintaining the Matrix open standard for decentralised communication, whose goal is to create an open and secure ecosystem for interoperable messaging, VoIP and IoT communication on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this talk is to give a simple insight of what quantum computing is, what makes it so different; to see when it poses a threat to existing crypto solutions and when it is not.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will show what quantum computing is: how cubit is different from an ordinary bit and what new opportunities this provides. We'll take a look at algorithms important for cryptanalysis. QCL — a free software tool to simulate quantum computer will be discussed as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second part of this talk an impact on widely used cryptographic algorithms will be discussed. Algorithms resilient to quantum computing will be reviewed. Codecrypt — a free GPG-like software for postquantum crypto will be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: this talk is intended to be an understandable overview, not a completely strict and full introduction to the subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Project documentation is so much more than just the formal manual. It's how you present yourself in all the forums where users may ask for help - IRC, mailing lists, StackOverflow, and in-person events. If you want people to use your project, and if you want people to join your project, you must be willing to listen to their needs, and be welcoming of their contributions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Definition: RTFM - Read The F'ing Manual. Occasionally it is ironically rendered as Read The Fine Manual. A phrase uttered at people who have asked a question that we, the enlightened, feel is beneath our dignity to answer, but not beneath our dignity to use as an opportunity to squish a newbie's ego. Documentation, and technical support in general, sets the tone for your community, in that it determines who sticks around. If you're a jerk, the next generation of your community will be composed of jerks. Based on 20 years of Open Source documentation experience, and lessons learned about not being a jerk, and crafting great documentation as a side-effect, this talk encourages you to see your entire project community as its documentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How to turn legacy docs into user-story-based, modular content to better serve users while reducing maintenance load and overall amount of docs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has become cumbersome to wade through chapters upon chapters of docs, looking for the relevant bits, especially with the advent of embedded applications, container deployments, and other usage scenarios that target highly specialized use cases. We need topic-based, action-oriented content to guide users through specific tasks. So, how do we turn the voluminous guides of yesterday into lean, modularized narratives that are easy to maintain, scale well, and still allow for a ‘guide-like’ experience when it is required? In this presentation, Robert Kratky will describe the work docs writers at Red Hat are doing to solve this problem: re-purposing the existing body of documentation, so that its parts – adapted into modular units to allow for reuse – can be dynamically combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Linux documentation has been perceived as lacking in user friendliness and oftentimes in quality or scope. This presentation will help attendees understand what problems Linux (and OSS) documentation faces, what is being done to remedy the problems, and how can existing documentation be improved or re-purposed to address future requirements and user expectations. The audience is anyone interested in documentation for Linux and open-source products, which includes technical writers, content strategists, support engineers, developers, and members of management who want to understand documentation processes and new methods of supporting users through documentation. Attendees can expect a presentation and discussion of ways to modernize existing documentation and adapt it for new expectations with regard to content consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the most well-known writers of literature, J.K. Rowling is a master of storytelling. What you might not have guessed is that open source and J.K. Rowling have something in common. The importance of storytelling in open source projects is as important as some of Rowling's famous characters in Harry Potter. In this session, speaker Justin W. Flory introduces the role of storytelling in open source projects and how to uncover that narrative. There a variety of tools and methods that can be used to help tell the story of project, particularly with data analysis. By the end audience members will understand the role of crafting the story of their open source project and how it motivates the community, what methods are avaiable for writing this story, and what the outcome of focusing on storytelling results in.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;J.K. Rowling has an ability to see a story and bring it to life through powerful methods of storytelling. But what you might not have guessed is that open source and J,K. Rowling both have something in common. The importance of storytelling in open source projects and communities is as important as some of Rowling's famous characters in Harry Potter. Finding ways to derive the story of a project community from lines of code, commit messages, and IRC conversations is a challenging but worthwhile task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this session, speaker Justin W. Flory introduces the role of storytelling in open source projects and how to best uncover that narrative. There are a variety of tools available to project communities to help them extract data to perform an analysis and mix of methods you can use regardless of what data you have available. Justin pulls from his experience as one of the founding members of the Fedora Community Operations team, working with team members with backgrounds in writing and data analysis, and the editor-in-chief of the Fedora Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the session, audience members will understand the role of crafting the story of their open source project and how it motivates the community, what methods are avaiable for writing this story, and what the outcome of focusing on storytelling results in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;RISC-V is a new open, royalty-free instruction set specification from the University of California, Berkeley that is finding its way into applications that range from IoT to supercomputing. With the advent of RISC-V, hardware implementers are now able to build fully open-source CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RISC-V distills over 30 years of RISC processor research at Berkeley and elsewhere into an extensible instruction set that can be fully customized. In this talk, we will discuss the goals of the RISC-V project and dig into the RISC-V instruction set. We will also give an overview of some popular open-source RISC-V hardware implementations as well as the RISC-V open-source software stack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Machine is a hardware project at Hewlett Packard Enterprise which
takes a new look at computer architecture. With many processors and
large amounts of directly addressable storage, The Machine program has
offered an equally large opportunity for developing new system
software. Our team at HPE has spent the better part of two years
writing new software and adapting existing software to expose the
capabilities of the hardware to application developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking off from my presentation at LCA 2016, this presentation will
explore the changes we've made throughout the Linux environment, from
security infrastructure to new file systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As directly addressable storage is such a large part of the new
hardware, this presentation will focus on a couple of important bits
of free software which expose that to applications, including our
Librarian File System and Managed Data Structures libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managed Data Structures introduces a new application programming
paradigm where the application works directly on the stable storage
form for data structures, eliminating serialization and
de-serialization operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the presentation will describe how the hardware is managed,
from sequencing power to a rack full of high-performance computing
hardware, through constructing custom Linux operating systems for each
processor and managing all of them as parts of a single computing
platform.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Tempesta FW: Linux Application Delivery Controller</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Miscellaneous</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Tempesta FW is a high performance open source Linux application
delivery controller (ADC). The project is built into the Linux TCP/IP stack to get
maximum performance for normal Web content delivery and efficient traffic
filtering for volumetric DDoS mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll start by considering a simple example of how to build an ADC using traditional
open source software. I'll describe drawbacks of the approach and why
we started Tempesta FW's development. Next I'll go into the project internals
and conclude the presentation with Tempesta FW performance benchmarks and
several examples.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Application delivery controllers (ADCs) are typically hardware appliances
that accelerate Web content delivery, intelligently balance loads among
upstream servers, employ QoS and traffic shaping to efficiently and elegantly
mitigate DDoS on all network layers, and provide Web application firewalling and
application performance monitoring. However, it seems there are no open source
projects that are able to perform these tasks with comparable performance and
accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I'll describe Tempesta FW - a high performance, open
source Linux application delivery controller. The project is built into the Linux
TCP/IP stack to get maximum performance for normal Web content delivery and
efficient traffic filtering for volumetric DDoS mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll start by considering a simple example of an installation of Nginx, Fail2Ban,
and IPtables. Alternative configurations containing other open source projects
will be covered as well. I'll describe why such configurations usually do a poor
job, and why we started Tempesta FW's development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I'll describe how Tempesta FW services HTTP requests, and how the HTTP layer
works with low-layer filter logic. There are several HTTP load-balancing
strategies, including flexible distribution of requests by almost any HTTP field
and predictive strategy by monitoring application performance.
Several technologies at the basis of Tempesta FW's performance will also be covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux TCP/IP stack optimizations for efficient HTTP proxying&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;stateless HTTP parsing and using AVX2 instruction set to efficiently process
HTTP strings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;lightweight in-memory database, TempestaDB, based on a cache-conscious
lock-free data structure used for servicing a web cache&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'll conclude with Tempesta FW performance benchmarks and show several
installation and configuration examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>LoRaWAN for exploring the Internet of Things </title>
        <subtitle>Talk Hard: A technical, political, and cultural look at LoRaWAN for IoT</subtitle>
        <track>Miscellaneous</track>
        <type>maintrack</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Everyone is excited about the The Internet of Things (IoT) and the possibilities of really seeing the democratization of the internet, devices for everyone needs, not just a few! If we are to achieve, then these devices must be design and built by everyone, we must create a Zine like industry, beyond the current makers of today, to enable people of all ages, gender (including non-binary), and race, to build devices suited to their own needs. LoRaWAN is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) specification intended for wireless battery operated Things in regional, national or global networks. LoRaWAN target key requirements of Internet of Things such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility and localization services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will introduce LoRaWAN as a key radio technology for IoT and walk through why it is a technologically important development as I show how to build LoRaWAN node applications to explore the possibility of IoT. There are a number of LoRaWAN networks emerging across Europe and I will highlight the political importance of why these networks should be open, supporting Open Data and Open Science and empowering the development of a new set application domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lecture will involve a demonstration of an LoRaWAN application that will showcase the both the node and Gateway aspects of a deployed network.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Soon, everything on Earth will be connected via peer-to-peer networking and/or the public Internet, with a multitude of sensor-driven devices dramatically changing our lives and our environment. These devices will be based on a wide variety of devices, ranging from tiny (e.g., microcontrollers) to huge (e.g., cloud servers), with one thing in common: they will require a radio connection to a Gateway that is connected to the internet, in some form or another. While Bluetooth LE or even Wi-fi might be used around the "smart" house or within a limited range, the battery limitations of the later and the range limitations of the former mean it is unlikely that these standards will form the backbone of a IoT network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For IoT there are a number of competing radio standards, e.g. LoRa and SigFox, both are long range and provide the ability to build nodes that are very low-power, with a potential battery life of 2 or more years, while providing a long range, often in access of 10km. A key feature of these standards is they are low-bandwidth, often each message is limited to 100 or so bytes, for SigFox even less. Each standard has its drawbacks but SigFox requires more expensive chipsets for the Gateway side of things, which is not the case for LoRa, and as such this has seen the development of community, crowd sourced, LoRa networks, based on LoRaWAN. One example of this is The Things Network, who community has been developing Gateways, nodes, cloud backends, and software to run on these, all open source, supporting open data and open science. In Bristol we are deploying a LoRaWAN network built on existing wireless infrastructure locations, provided by Bristol Wireless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this lecture I will introduce LoRaWAN from a technical perspective, providing examples, and also look at the IoT and LoRaWAN networks from a political perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will bring a portable LoRaWAN network that we have developed at the University of West of England, mostly for testing radio capabilities but also allowing us to demo LoRaWAN and IoT on the move, and also some example nodes, some of which will be used by the audience. This will demonstrate the use of The Things Network backend infrastructure to provide an internet backend and bring the internet part of Internet of Things. We will provide demos that the audience will be able to interact with during the session and see the results live during the talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Software is (often) distributed as binary. But where is the corresponding source code? Given a binary, how can you find out which source code was used to compile?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using advanced techniques and open source tools, we can find out which source code was built in a binary. The applications are important for FOSS license compliance and/or enforcement as well as general code hygiene and build sanity.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Can you tell exactly which files are baked into the binaries of the software you build and distribute?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many applications for this knowledge:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;facts finding for FOSS license compliance and enforcement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;better control of what third-party code you use and depend on and their related FOSS license requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;general software and build hygiene such as pruning obsolete or dead code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With clarity on what's in your binary, you can better understand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if a file is really used or not and what it is used for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if and how files are linked together such as static vs. dynamic linking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if some extra files are pulled from network repositories at build time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are your build and runtime dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We will review why this does matter, present available FOSS tools and techniques to get back to the corresponding sources from built binaries using dynamic build tracing and static analysis; and the applications, usage and caveats of these techniques for various programming languages and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So join me and let's find out &lt;em&gt;what's in your binary!&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Most small businesses have no patent strategy. Though many FOSS companies have policies in place regarding copyright and keeping detailed records of code contributions, few have paid enough attention to how patent litigation could affect them. For those FOSS businesses active in multiple countries or looking to expand into an international market, failure to understand the patent ecosystem in each jurisdiction could be a costly mistake.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

For those FOSS businesses active in multiple countries or looking to expand into an international market, failure to understand the patent ecosystem in each jurisdiction could be a costly mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will use recent cases and ongoing changes in the patent systems of the US &amp;amp; Europe as modern examples for our discussion. We'll describe the pitfalls that can affect any company, tabulate the costs of litigation, and offer methods businesses can use to reduce overall risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the future of the European Union's Unitary Patent Court in limbo due to the Brexit, and with no public position on patents from the United States' next administration, leaders in Free Software owe it to themselves and their companies to be more agile and more prepared to address patent issues -- whether they work at a small startup or at a large multinational corporation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Hacking the patent system.</subtitle>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many people, also software developers, put their inventions or innovations on the 'market' without filing patents. For good reasons: the patent privileges to exclude others are not really compatible with freedoms and openness. However, to protect your freedom to operate, you need to avoid that others file a patent on your invention. Open Patents are a new way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Software patents are still a threat. When you publish your software code, a company or a patent troll might file a patent for the inventions in your code. The patent offices should not grant patents for existing knowledge ('prior art'), but they will have a very hard time to find the ideas in your code. As such the troll might succeed in getting the patent, and might stop you and everyone else from further exploitation of your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patents are a classical protection against patents, but it's an expensive and overly offensive solution. Defensive publications are another solution. But this concept is not well known and doesn't get a lot of recognition. The established implementations are commercial, have a per page publication fee and hide the defensive publications behind a paywall. The Defensive Publications program, a component of Linux Defenders, uses such commercial channel, but waives the publication fee and republishes openly outside the paywall. This solution is however for a very narrow (Free software) field and lacks the popularity it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://openpatentoffice.org/"&gt;The Open Patent Office&lt;/a&gt; is a non-profit organization that aims to stimulate innovation by providing an open, free and social alternative to the traditional patent offices. It allows inventors to register their innovative ideas as open patents. Open patents act as defensive publications. The Open Patent Office publishes these descriptions, timestamps them, gives them an open patent number, classifies them, facilitates discussion and facilitates easy searching and finding by patent examiners and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will summarize the case law on the contract or license
question in the U.S. Certain obligations under the GPL may be merely
contractual, meaning there are less damages and enforcement mechanisms
available to a plaintiff, while other obligations may have more teeth.
I will use this analysis to help the community think about how it
might craft software licenses in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk examines the way the free software community communicates with one another, and ways codes of conduct and community guidelines affect language. By analyzing mailing lists, looking at the frequency with which participants use slurs and expletives before and after the institution of codes of conduct, we can see how effective these policies are, and what sort of spaces they are creating for community members and project contributors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk is the follow up to talks at Libre Planet (2016) and SeaGL (2016), taking a mostly (and then progressively less) humorous look on language used on Twitter and mailing lists, and the positive and negative ways we use strong language to talk about free software, and talk to each other about free software. This talk will include a general look at the purpose of codes of conduct and community guidelines, what sort of things make one policy "good" or "bad," and, when possible, the process by a given community agrees on the institution of one. It will then focus on statistical analysis of language use on a chosen number of mailing lists (including the Linux Kernel Mailing List), with outstanding examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will likely include some strong language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Why we need a legal framework to operate successfull a Trusted Service Provider</title>
        <subtitle>An overview of some internals of our Trusted Service Provider</subtitle>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The world of PKI and the interactions between browsers and Certificate Authorities are very complex these days. We are creating a Trusted Service Provider (TSP) to deploy to the public reliable certificates for free, free as in "free beer". What are the requirements to deliver extended validated certificates? Why do you have to pay for it? What will be the price? We believe that it is one of our principle rights to secure our identity and privacy in the digital space. You can't buy a basic right but you can organize an environment to make the best use of it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The talk gives an overview of our setup of a new Trusted Service Provider. The heart of all is a non-profit organization in Austria which will lead some legal bodies required to operate successfull. This NPO is open for all people who accept the United Declaration of Human Rights. We think this is a key factor for success. But a NPO like this is not a Certificate Authority. We need another organisation to take over all tasks of a CA which has to pass an audit with flying colours. A successfull performed audit is the key factor to play a reliable role in the market. Certificates will be accepted. Trust between this CA and the end users will be established. Last but not least a money flow must be organized. Individuals will get their certificates always for free. What about organizations? I will point out that a special kind of association will do and will work. The software to operate the CA is developed from scratch. Of course the software will be published under a FLOSS license.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Seamless secure (TLS) connections on the internet are underpinned by the Web PKI - a system where Certificate Authorities (CAs) issue identity certificates to people and sites, and clients such as browsers have a "trusted root" list of those they think will do that job right. Mozilla runs the only open and transparently root program, which defines what Firefox (and probably your Linux distro) trusts; this talk explains how we use that power to make the Internet a safer and more secure place.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Increasingly permissive or increasingly dismissive?</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In advanced free software legal and policy circles, a disturbing
number of conversations treat it as given that fewer new projects are
choosing copyleft licenses, and more are going the route of lax
permissive. Though this has been repeated in news articles and blog
posts, when we look deeper for evidence of the claim, we find either
anecdotes (often from the field of corporate-backed project license
choices), or highly questionable and unscientific data sets. Is it
really so?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In advanced free software legal and policy circles, a disturbing
number of conversations treat it as given that fewer new projects are
choosing copyleft licenses, and more are going the route of lax
permissive. Though this has been repeated in news articles and blog
posts, when we look deeper for evidence of the claim, we find either
anecdotes (often from the field of corporate-backed project license
choices), or highly questionable and unscientific data sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the claim is repeated by people just trying to set the table
for other discussions about trends in free software or open source;
sometimes it is promoted by people specifically arguing against
copyleft (especially in business); sometimes it is raised as a concern
by people defending copyleft. All three situations are worrisome in
their own ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was all true in 2012, when I gave my talk "Is copyleft being
framed?", but things have gotten worse since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll discuss:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) new "data" and articles published since 2012, including issues with
my own methodology;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) whether the contexts in which permissive license use does appear to
be increasing mean what they are purported to mean, and whether those
contexts are actually relying purely on permissive licenses or on
other sorts of supplementary legal structures;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) prominent instances of copyleft usage, especially the AGPL and GPL;
and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) different ways to study and understand the trends people are trying
to get at when they talk about licensing choices in quantitative
terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a community with so many computer scientists, lawyers, and talented
researchers, it's important that we habitually put popular assumptions
up for critique. Assumptions and bits of conventional wisdom need to
be audited just like code, to ensure that the business plans and
movement-organizing decisions which flow from them aren't based on
rotten foundations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As a FOSS/OSHW project grows, at some stage it often reaches a point where it
requires a legal entity for better operation – whether this be to gather
donations, pay for development, handle finances, organise events, consolidate
rights, better governance or other reasons. So far in Europe there were no
alternatives to setting up your own legal entity, and with it a huge tonne of
work and obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But finally three host/umbrella organisations have just emerged in Europe and
aim to offload this overhead from your projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join our panel to learn if and which of these organisations could help your
project flourish best, as well as pose any open questions or concerns you may
still have.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Panelists include&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>FOSS and the GDPR</title>
        <subtitle>Overview of key changes to EU privacy law that FOSS can use to promote individual's privacy and autonomy </subtitle>
        <track>Legal and Policy Issues</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The last year has seen significant changes to European Privacy. Last April the EU approved the GDPR, a comprehensive replacement for the European Privacy regime. The GDPR is a technology neutral regulation that has wide spread impacts on how individuals and business will use computers and the Internet worldwide. Free Software has an opportunity to help achieve the goal of the GDPR by baking in privacy and compliance into free software. This presentation will talk about key elements of the GDPR that free software is positioned to take advantage of to increase adoption of free software and promote privacy.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This presentation will discuss what the General Data Protection Regulation is, the scope of its impact, and how FOSS developers can align their efforts with the GDPR to promote individual's privacy and on-line autonomy. Most of the presentation will be spent discussing requirements of the GDPR and corresponding features that can be implemented in FOSS software to help organizations to comply with both the letter and the spirit of the GDPR. By becoming aware of the demands the GDPR will be placing on organizations using FOSS, developers can invest in improvements to their projects that help organizations comply in a way that benefits individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will briefly review the structural changes from the current European Privacy regime, the Data Protection Directive. Key changes include a uniform implementation throughout Europe and new mechanisms for enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GDPR will go into effect in May 2018. Organizations from small community groups to large multinational organizations are currently under going the process of reviewing their privacy policies and IT infrastructure to determine the best ways to comply with key changes. Many of the changes are designed to promote individual’s control over their own data and enable individuals better control over their personal data and on-line privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GDPR applies to most individuals and organizations located in Europe or doing business with Europeans. Organizations subject to the GDPR include European government entities, private companies, nonprofit charities, social organizations and in some cases individuals. None of the GDPR’s requirements force FOSS developers to make modifications, but these new requirements may create new demands from FOSS users. The GDPR may also create new opportunities for FOSS developers to interact with online services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GDPR sets general standards that seek to be technology neutral, but this flexibility comes at the cost of specifics. FOSS has an opportunity to raise the standard for compliance with the GDPR by implementing features that enable compliance with the GDPR that promote individuals privacy and personal autonomy. Key changes include enshrining the right to be forgotten in the regulation, mandating data portability for digital services, requiring companies to receive affirmative consent before using personal data, and increasing transparency about how organizations use individuals’ data. FOSS developers have the opportunity to increase adoption of their project by helping enable organizations comply with those regulations by implementing features to make compliance easier. Implementing those features in a user friendly way is also a way to influence organizations to comply with the GDPR in a way that respects individual’s privacy. Large businesses will need to comply but many of them will be motivated to do the bare minimum required to minimize expenses. May small organizations may have difficulty compling with out assistance from the FOSS community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key features that FOSS developers can lead the way in implementing include compliance with data portability by creating open protocols and file formats for data exportation between online social network and digital media platforms including blogs, email, and cloud storage. Compliance with the right to be forgotten and transparency can be implemented by giving users greater freedom to see what data software has recorded about them and the ability to remove or purge some or all of that data on demand. Enabling audit logging of data use and transfers by default will encourage organizations seeking to comply with the GDPR to adopt FOSS software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOSS developers can update their user registration process for on-line platforms to enable asking users for informed consent and designing software to require users to opt-in to the use of their personal data. FOSS developers can also implement compliance by default with related European privacy directives that require consent before using cookies and storing data on individual’s computers by automatically seeking consent before storing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GDPR’s effects are not limited to just European residents organizations. Large and small organizations around the world are seeking to comply with the GDPR. FOSS developers have the opportunity to enable individuals from around the world to take advantage of many of the practical benefits of the GDPR by including features required by the GDPR by default in their projects. Many of the largest technology companies from the U.S. will need to comply the data exportation rules because they operate in Europe. Many smaller companies based outside of the EU will also need to align their policies with GDPR when they enroll in related programs such as the U.S.’s Privacy Shield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outline:
* What is the GDPR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* When will it go into effective    
* What happened to the Data Protection Directive
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GDPR will require organizations to implement new changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will the GDPR affect FOSS?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do FOSS developers have to comply with the GDPR?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do FOSS users have to comply with the GDPR?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FOSS used in business or other none personal activities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government agencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For profit companies

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multinational companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small businesses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nonprofit organizations

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;traditional charities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;local clubs and social organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kinds of software will be most impacted by the GDPR?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Websites?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ePrivacy Directive (the Cookie Directive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Networking?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Media?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Databases?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Case Management Software?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer and employee management software?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does the GDPR require?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“right to be forgotten”?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving users the ability to delete personal data of individuals from the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data transparency

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving users access to see what data exists about themselves and to correct it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data portability

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developing community standards for exporting and importing data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no requirement to use formal data standards, but it must be practical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set the standard for exchanging data with propriety systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is intended to encourage more competition in online services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collecting consent by affirmative action

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;building in user registration processes the ability to collect affirmative consent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ability to customize what users are consenting to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;building in the ability to for users to web applications differently depending on their level of consent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enabling data protection by design

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;building and documenting FOSS software using secure designs, so that FOSS can serve as the foundation for privacy by design systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configuring defaults in applications that are private by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bake auditing of data access, modification, and transfer into systems

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organizations subject to the GDPR need to track where and how personal data is being used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to audit when personal data is accessed or used enables organizations to demonstration compliance easier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software that enables it will be more attractive for both big and small organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does the GDPR affect US and other companies based outside of the EU?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google, Facebook,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PrivacyShield

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data privacy is a human right

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schrems case against facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The U.S. Privacy Shield has been approved

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U.S. extends Amreican’s privacy rights to EU nationals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it will probably be more effective then Safe Harbor could have ever hoped to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FTC has noticeably stepped up enforcement activity around data security and privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Companies are using more free software than ever, but often with little or no understanding of the licenses or the community norms that are part of the package.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Companies are using more free software than ever, but often with little or no understanding of the licenses or the community norms that are part of the package. When it comes to talking about free software legal tools, we need to control the message. If we let other entities fill in the gaps in our outreach strategy, a lot of context and nuance will be lost. A poor or incomplete message hinders our ability to gain more widespread acceptance of free software tools and practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suing collaborators or consciously working to erode well-established community norms for short term gain has no place in the world the free software community is trying to build. Massive, globally useful, customizable software projects aren't merely a side effect of publicly available repositories, they're a product of intentionally cooperative communities with rules and legal safeguards. The FOSS community's message must be, "If you don't respect our legal tools, then you aren't a free or open source software company."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Policy isn't made by coders. Official government policy is made by judges and legislators and company policy is made by engaging with business and legal teams. We need to foster better understanding of our tools and norms amongst policy makers. This talk will offer ideas on how we should craft and deliver our message around the adoption of free software legal tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;A thread on an open source project mailing list offers seven lessons on how to engage an open source community over legal issues.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A thread on an Apache mailing list (Now safely in the past) provides a great illustration of what not to do when your employer's interests seem to need engagement in an open source community. Instead of asking a suitably-trained lawyer to directly engage, the company asked an engineer to engage when they wanted special terms for a contribution. They went on to propose custom terms, a custom CLA and even implied that they wanted private bilateral negotiations. This session runs through the thread and draws seven lessons for approaching an open source community with your legal issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk explores client authentication in PostgreSQL, ranging from "trust" to SSL certificates and enterprise authentication systems like GSSAPI (Kerberos). We will discuss security and compliance implications, but also the performance impact and operational aspects as password changes.
The presentation also includes typical usage scenarios and practical configuration advice.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered what might be the best data type for a certain use case? Is it better to use INTEGER or BIGINT, and should you use TIMESTAMP or is it better to use TIMESTAMPTZ? When is the last time you migrated a legacy database and wondered what to use as replacement for VARCHAR2 or CHAR(255)? How to store IP addresses or geographical data, does that fit into VARCHAR or is there something more suitable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL 9.6 comes with around 40 different data types preinstalled. This talk looks beyond INTEGER and VARCHAR and dives into some of the lesser known PostgreSQL data types. Use cases and examples show which data type is a good fit for a certain situation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle/>
        <track>PostgreSQL</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;PostgreSQL is an awesome project and it evolves at an amazing rate. The talk will focus on evolution of fault tolerance capabilities in PostgreSQL throughout its versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will cover the topics listed below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robustness of PostgreSQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PostgreSQL Fault Tolerance: WAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transaction? Commit? Checkpoint?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replication Methods for PostgreSQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical Replication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standby Modes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streaming Replication and WAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failover and Switchover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronous Commit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing Timeline Issues: pg_rewind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trigger-based Replication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logical Decoding : BDR and pglogical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are several ways of how to look at fault tolerance. In this sense PostgreSQL provides different means of achieving fault tolerance and dependability either out of the box solutions or using extensions depending on what are the user’s priorities about their system. General fault tolerance in PostgreSQL is improving over time and I expect this trend to continue.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Infrastructure Monitoring with Postgres</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>PostgreSQL</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The revolt against SQL continues at a steady but considerably slower pace. Bespoke database software seems to crop up daily in the name of performance or functionality. This talk will examine the ever growing field of monitoring systems and their respective databases, and look in depth as to how Postgres can be used in a number of these places. Systems of this nature are typically tasked with collecting and storing metrics from your infrastructure, drawing pretty graphs, and nagging you when things break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forms of data stored by these systems are nothing to be afraid of - they often include:
- Time series metrics - the history of a measurement over time, e.g. temperatures
- Logs - unstructured text emitted by applications, operating systems and hardware
- Events  - schema-less but well structured notifications&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An assertion of this talk is that for a majority of use cases, Postgres is more than capable of storing all of this data. We will attempt to replace numerous well known pieces of software with just one Postgres database. Of course we are told to use the right tool for the job, but having to learn and operate a single tool is a huge operational advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll get quite technical in this talk, take a look the data models and access patterns required, and how this can be fitted into the general purpose environment of Postgres. Additionally, it is always constructive to look at what can be problematic, and not just focus on the positives, and why many turn to other bespoke solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The PostgreSQL documentation explains in detail how to do backup and replication, maybe too detailed for beginners or "part-time" DBAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are some common misconceptions about data safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk gives a comprehensive, yet brief overview of the different approaches to perform backup/restore, point-in-time recovery and replication, advising on what to use in different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some typical misconceptions and pitfalls are addressed as well.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;strace is a diagnostic, debugging and instructional utility for Linux.
It is used to monitor interactions between processes and the Linux kernel,
which include system calls, signal deliveries, and changes of process state.
In 2016, strace has been extended to tamper with tracees using syscall
fault injection, making strace also a syscall fault injection tool, the
only unprivileged userspace command-line runtime tool of this kind for
Linux.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The last summer as a part of strace GSoC 2016 project Nahim El Atmani has implemented a prototype
of syscall fault injection - a software testing technique used for improving test coverage
of error handling code paths that might otherwise rarely be followed by introducing faults.
Now the feature has finally been implemented and is a part of strace 4.15 released in December 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk the maintainer of strace will demonstrate the new feature, describe its implementation,
and show examples of real bugs found with its help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Pipeline is quickly establishing itself as the direction that Jenkins jobs are going, enabling the definition of a complete CD pipeline in a single job; Pipeline as Code via the “Jenkinsfile”; job durability across master restarts; and more. I’ll be talking here about the next evolution for Pipeline that is just now hitting 1.0: a simple, declarative model to define your Pipelines with no need to write scripts. This configuration syntax for Pipeline allows you to automatically configure all stages of your pipeline, the complete build environment, post-build actions, notifications and more. All while providing syntactic and semantic validation before the build actually gets going. We'll also play with the just-released initial version of the Pipeline Editor, built to work with Declarative!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Infer: A static analyzer for catching bugs before you ship</title>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Static analyzers are automated tools that spot bugs in source code by scanning programs without running them. They complement traditional dynamic testing: Where testing allows individual runs through a piece of software to be checked for correctness, static analysis allows multiple and sometimes even all flows to be checked at once. Infer is an open-source static analyzer that is used internally at Facebook to analyze the main apps for Android and iOS, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp, among others. Infer reports bugs responsible for app crashes and performance issues, such as accessing null pointers, and leaking resources such as Context instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each month, hundreds of potential bugs identified by Infer are fixed by our developers before they are committed to our codebases and deployed to people's phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will present Infer and show how it can be integrated as part of the development workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The German Weather Service (DWD) provides over 25 thousand climate time series from meteorological stations across Germany via an FTP server, but it is not always easy to find out which datasets are available. To facilitate file selection and (automated) downloads, I developed an R package that can be used to select, download, read and process weather data. The aim of the package is that researchers can focus on scientific problems instead of data management. At FOSDEM, I would like to present the main instructions for the package, how the FOSS community aided in putting it together, and give a brief outlook on the potential analysis types.
The package is FOSS at https://github.com/brry/rdwd#rdwd&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

The plugin extends the options for the LeafletJS Standard API elements Marker, CircleMarker, Popup, ImageOverlay and GeoJSON so you can publish these map elements in HTML semantically annotated ‐ and therewith machine readable web maps. While there is quite some effort already around the development of new geospatial data catalogs (which are awesome) this plugin turns the focus onto geographic web maps. Acknowleding that, de-facto, some maps already are data catalogs themselves, they are just not that well represented in HTML so that other programs can extract and re-use the information people collect in them.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Khartis results from an observation: how can we create easily a statistical map, with a few clicks, without loosing the scientific accuracy and rigor while processing the data?
Khartis is not the first mapping tool available online! It is, however, one of the few to propose different perspectives of the world representation among which the cartographer will choose.
In order to feed the tool with data, you may want to retrieve from the Khartis website the data used to produce the maps given as examples or to import or copy / paste your own datasets. The base maps are geo-referenced and allow you to work on the proposed entities (countries, regions...) but also on objects identified by pairs of coordinates. You can choose between several projections (besides Mercator) and configure the visual appearance of your data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;City Focus is a web-based interactive 2D and 3D GIS application to find the best place in a city to live as well as to pass shorter staying. The user can select among different criteria and decide their importance by assigning weights to each of them. The application provides thematic maps displaying insights on the places which better fit the user’s preferences. The resulting map is computed through map algebra by means of Web Coverage Processing Service WCPS provided by RASDAMAN Database Management System. Data visualization is mainly based on  NASA Web WorldWind open-source virtual globe. The app exploits exclusively open data as well as Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for its implementation by enabling continuous improvements while minimizing development costs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;City Focus is a work-in-progress application, winner of the MYGEOSS third call for innovative Apps, launched by the European Commission (http://digitalearthlab.jrc.ec.europa.eu/mygeoss/results3.cfm). The call focused on developing applications of European relevance able to provide users with quantitative or qualitative information on the changing environment, taking into account broad environmental or social themes across geographic scales, stressing the use of openly available or crowd-generated data in different domains addressing citizens’ needs (Raglia &amp;amp; Craglia, 2015).
City Focus is a web-based interactive 2D and 3D GIS application to find the best place in a city to live, or to pass shorter staying. The user can select among different criteria and decide their importance by assigning weights to each of them. The application provides thematic maps displaying insights on the places which better fit the user’s preferences. The resulting map is computed through map algebra upon a cascade of pre-built raster maps. Users are guided in the requests through a predefined list of criteria including: air quality, precipitation, terrain morphology (e.g. slope, solar exposure, etc.), temperature, proximity to urban facilities (e.g. schools, transportations, sports fields, cultural attractions, healthcare centers, parking lots, shops, etc.), presence of public spaces, land use characteristics (e.g. commercial areas, residential areas, etc.), population density, traffic or internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Google Summer of Code offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source projects. OSGeo participated as mentor org for 10 years now. We will give an outline of the amazing tools developed during the 2016 edition, by our 22 students. The Open Source Geospatial Foundation, or OSGeo, is a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to support the collaborative development of open source geospatial software, and promote its widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Last April OpenStreetMap got a new open-source editor: MAPS.ME. It was a first popular editing application both for iOS and Android phones, with millions of users. Suddenly a quarter of daily editors were maps.me users, who behaved quite differently from regular, hardcore mappers. This talk explains how we made editing OpenStreetMap possible offline, without an access to the constantly updating database, how we and our users repeatedly broke OSM data, and which tools and algorithms there are for fixing the map.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Easily creating location-based applications with OSMAlchemy</title>
        <subtitle>Learn how to create (web) applications using real-world map data with as little resources as possible</subtitle>
        <track>Geospatial</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Location-based applications grow in importance, not only for the augmented reality gaming community, but also for businesses adding location-aware functionality to their web applications, mobile apps and the like. We show how to work with the vast set of OpenStreetMap data with minimal Python programming and very little resources using the OSMAlchemy library.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, we will create a web application that uses the live set of OpenStreetMap data to allow users to review places like restaurants, bars and the like. Doing so, we will use the following technologies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Python programming language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Flask micro-framework for web applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an SQLite database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the SQLAlchemy object-relational mapper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the OSMAlchemy library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Angular.JS framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When writing applications that use OpenStreetMap, one had to decide whether to only use a really small subset of the data or maintain their own local copy of the whole planet data, which accumulates to more than 1 TB of data and consumes a lot of resources to work with it. OSMAlchemy provides access to the live data through the Overpass API in combination with a local, SQLAlchemy-based cache. It also allows access to the complete set of OpenStreetMap data by simply querying SQLAlchemy, without even caring about Overpass API access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After attending the workshop, you will be able to implement arbitrary applications using whatever OpenStreetMap features you like. You should have some basic knowledge about Python and relational databases. Having heard about Flask, REST and SQLAlchemy gives you an extra bonus, but is not strictly necessary. If you want to try the examples during the workshop, please make sure to have the most recent (stable) versions of Python 3, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Restless and OSMAlchemy installed beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;More than fifteen years ago airspace-v.com was launched. A web site with map data for general aviation. In the meantime resources for mapping and for aviation information have changed and improved a lot. Web site airspace-v.com is under refurbishment now. It is becoming an application of OpenStreetMap showing information collected from public sources on the net. Here you can see which information is presented on the map and you can learn a few implementation details for efficient database querying of distances and a file based location name lookup that is extremely fast.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Creating georeferenced digital elevation models from unmanned aerial vehicle images</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Geospatial</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) on the one hand, and the availability of Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm [1] in the opensource Micmac [2, 3, 4] software suite (French National Geographic Institute, IGN) for generating Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and orthophotos on the other hand, we describe the processing chain to acquire and geoereference DEMs in QGIS. The fast acquisition and very high (sub-meter) resolution are well suited for repeated measurements and assess terrain morphological changes. The processing sequence is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;fly and acquire georeferenced images. If only a GPS receiver and camera are aboard the UAV, matching time tag with GPS date and time will allow for georeferencing the pictures (exiftool)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;identify matching points between adjacent images: the GPS position is used to reduce the number of comparisons and limit the lengthy analysis to nearest neighbors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;identify lens properties, bringing the largest cause of uncertainty in the model generation, from various pictures of the same ground feature exhibiting as much height variation as possible,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;generate coarse point cloud to assess camera position and matching algorithm consistency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;generate dense point cloud, orthophoto and DEM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;include the resulting georeferenced pointcloud in QGis, converting the (arbitrary TIF) pixel value to quantitative height (meters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate sub-meter resolution DEM generation in vegetation-less environments (urban, glacier moraine) while coarse-acquisition (C/A) single-frequency GPS only allows for 5-m accuracy, hence requiring an additional ground control point matching step for repeated DEM comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Big Spatio-Temporal Datacubes on Steroids ...and Standards</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Geospatial</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;With the advent of the massive deluge in Earth data, serving them to diverse communities is increasingly promising and challenging alike. A useful abstraction for spatio-temporal raster data (and beyond) is the coverage data model, as standardized by ISO, OGC, and INSPIRE. Rather than zillions of individual image files it provides spatio-temporal "datacubes" for simple, efficient handling through the corresponding service model, the Web Coverage Service (WCS) with its Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) geo analytics language - "one cube tells more than a million images".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source rasdaman ("raster data manager") is the official reference implementation of both OGC and INSPIRE WCS. It supports easy incremental construction and maintenance of spatio-temporal datacubes, based on the OGC WCS-T standard. Retrieval may use WMS for visual navigation, WCS for data extraction and download, and WCPS for massive server-side processing. On server side, adaptive data partitioning and "tile streaming" processing enables fast query responses. In July 2016, US magazine CIO Review has included rasdaman in its top 100 Big Data technologies list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we present coverages in terms of concepts, implementation, and large-scale application. Live demos underpin the talk, using publicly accessible sites where the audience can replay and modify the examples. Being editor of the OGC and ISO coverage standard the presenter can give first-hands insights and answers, such as about the new generalized grid model for coverages (CIS 1.1) which OGC has adopted in Fall 2016 as well as the newly adopted INSPIRE-WCS. This is an excellent opportunity to learn about the state of the art and standards in an open, free-of-cost setup.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;GIS development was ramped up in MySQL 5.7, and we expect GIS support to be greatly improved in the coming versions. MySQL 8.0 is still in development, but we're starting to see the first GIS enhancements pushed into development releases. What is new? In which direction is MySQL going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will look at the plans for GIS in future versions of MySQL, and in MySQL 8.0 in particular. We'll cover the big overarching design decisions, what it means for the future direction of GIS in MySQL, and how it translates into implementation of specific new functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is both for those that know GIS and would like to know what MySQL can offer, and for those that know MySQL GIS today and want to know what to expect in future versions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Gnucap, the GNU circuit analysis package, is a flexible mixed-signal circuit simulator with significant technical advantages over SPICE derivatives. One is modularity. Gnucap implements a dynamic loader for extesions adding language support or component models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, some of the extensions for an experimental fork have been adapted to the the main line. An overview over the development progress and available functionality will be provided. This talk will demonstrate the use of geda schematics and verilog device models in Gnucap driven circuit simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since too long we use VHDL and Verilog to describe hardware.
SpinalHDL is an alternative language which do his best to prove that is time to do a paradigms shift in hardware description.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;SpinalHDL is a Scala library which allow to describe RTL by using object oriented programming and functional programming.
This presentation will present basics of SpinalHDL and then show by which way this alternative approach offer a huge benefit in the code clarity, genericity and reusability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Digital hardware design: what can we learn from software development – and what not?</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Electronic Design Automation (EDA)</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the goal of digital hardware design has been to produce an ASIC. Ideally one which works perfectly after the first tapeout. Tailored towards this goal are our development and testing processes: strictly following a V-model with separated development and verification teams, long design iterations and code which, once it's known to work, is never touched again. For people coming from the software world, this development approach looks arcane. Where are all the sprints, the agile methods, the quick iterations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With FPGAs being on the rise and available in more and more cloud data centers and possibly bundled with our next Intel processor, we finally get the chance to cheaply make mistakes in digital hardware designs: no more wasted tapeouts, just a new flashing of the FPGA is necessary to fix a bug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join me in this talk for a look at development processes and tools. Where can we build bridges between the software and hardware development world, and where do we have fundamentally different needs?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <subtitle>Display and edit Gerber RS247X files the easy way</subtitle>
        <track>Electronic Design Automation (EDA)</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Working with Gerber files today is a task done by CAM personnel using extremely expensive and proprietary software. Until today no easy way exists to edit Gerber files through an API. What only few know is that libgerbv from the Geda project has proper support to not only show but also to edit Gerber files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the Ruby bindings for libgerbv it is now possible to edit Gerber files through a simple API.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Working with Gerber files within the PCB manufacturing process takes a large chunk of the work as a lot of tasks like panelization are done directly within these files. However, until today there is no easy or an open source way to work with these files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Geda Team has done a great job with their Gerbv software as it is used worldwide to check Gerber files for correctness before production. What most people do not know is that libgerbv, which is used under the hood, is also capable of editing Gerber files. One of the reasons might be, that libgerbv is not accessible by most software engineers.
To overcome this we, i.e. AISLER, have developed a simple Ruby binding for libgerbv. Using the API it is possible to load, edit and save Gerber files with just a few lines of code. Possible use cases are panelization, adding fiducials, receiving design information such as drill count and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now the libgerbv ruby bindings (which will probably get some more catchy name later) are used within our own PCB manufacturing process at https://go.aisler.net. They'll be published during FOSDEM 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Xorn is a recent addition to the gEDA/gaf project.  It implements a value-oriented data model which serves as an interface between core functionality, the user interface, and scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk provides an overview of what the design principles behind Xorn are, which particular technical decisions followed from these, how this has been implemented in gEDA/gaf so far and what possible paths of
development this opens up for both gEDA and other projects.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Let's be sincere, all of us would love to change something in KiCad. I bet you have an idea for a new tool or another killer feature that would make your life so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what? You are free to do so! Even more, you are welcome to contribute to the project, and it is not that difficult as one may think.
Those who have browsed the source code might find it overwhelming at first, but the truth is: you do not have to know everything to create useful extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to invite you for a walk through the KiCad source code to demonstrate how easy it is to add this tool you have always been dreaming about.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <track>Electronic Design Automation (EDA)</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Footwork is an experimental KiCAD footprint (text) editor written in Racket. Footwork takes advantage of Lisp's code-data equivalence to offer a unique approach to PCB design: KiCAD's footprint format becomes a domain specific language embedded in the Racket programming language.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Footwork's interface is text first allowing users to make arbitrary edits: their requirements need not be fully anticipated by the user interface.
The users still immediately see the effects of their edits through a graphical preview but can use a fully featured general purpose programming languages to generate and modify footprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional (mouse based) manipulation is being added as calls to scripting. Most interestingly, Racket's Rosette language, an interface to SMT solvers, offers the opportunity to make use of cutting edge techniques in programming synthesis for design automation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;1-click BOM is a browser extension that lets you easily buy required parts given a bill of materials. This was first presented at FOSDEM in 2015 and in this talk Kaspar catches us up on the progress since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting bits to come out of this development is the project sharing site Kitnic.it: a registry for open source hardware that makes complete PCB designs easier to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of the development of these applications is a tour of the pains and joys of developing electronic design tools for the web with Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;We know the expression ‘Open Source’; what about ‘Open Design’? How could we define ‘Open Design’?
Design creative process is not disclosed. The secrecy around it is of the utmost importance in order to prevent the original creations from being stolen. The different stages of the process and the techniques used are only known by those involved in the design.
How could we call this stance into question and open the creative process?
This talk will present existing initiatives and thoughts to make Graphic Design and Open Fonts fields more available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We know the expression ‘Open Source’; what about ‘Open Design’? How could we define ‘Open Design’?
Design creative process is not disclosed. The secrecy around it is of the utmost importance in order to prevent the original creations from being stolen. The different stages of the process and the techniques used are only known by those involved in the design.
How could we call this stance into question and open the creative process?
This talk will present existing initiatives and thoughts to make Graphic Design and Open Fonts fields more available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I will introduce graphic designers and typographers who open their process: why do they share their practice? why is it interesting? how and why is it useful?
I will talk about originality and copy: we should not be afraid of copying. Moreover copying can be an opportunity to improve the original design.
About Mozilla rebranding: I will point out some suggestions to further that initiative. How could designers take part and get committed?
Finally I will give designers food for thought to defend their work, explain and communicate it, and better collaborate with their team and people who are not designers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The decision of creating a jobs board as part of the Open Source Design project was no doubt an excellent one. Our conversations during the first Open Source Design devroom showed that a place to match designers with FOSS projects was sorely needed. At November 19th, the jobs board has received 53 submissions. I consider this a success, given our limited reach and the small size of the Open Source Design initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going through the content of those 53 submissions shows a clear pattern: the overwhelming majority are looking for graphic designers, and many of them are asking for a project logo.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Although graphic design is absolutely fundamental to software, and branding elements such as logos help projects develop and strengthen their identity, user-centered design is much more than that, as the content of our devrooms illustrate. It is also important to understand that good graphic design does not exist in isolation: it is embedded within the work of other user-centered design disciplines and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User research, information architecture, interaction design and content strategy can make valuable contributions to FOSS projects. The question is, how? What needs to change for FOSS projects to identify the need of an information architect or a user researcher? Is it just about building knowledge and awareness about these branches of design? Or do these disciplines require some fundamental changes to the way contributions happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is more about questions than answers. It will provide a brief introduction to the different "layers" of the user-centered design process as outlined by Jesse James Garrett (http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements.pdf), and will pose some questions about how to incorporate them into FOSS projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the answers to those questions is one of the reasons why we need the Open Source Design community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Mozilla has been doing quite some efforts in 2016 to open up more non-technical contribution areas, including design. What started with Community Design in January 2016, evolved and inspired a new rebranding process of the Mozilla brand, by opening it up to a broader audience who were able to follow and comment on the process step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will have a look back at 2016, what we learned from Open Design at Mozilla and introduce the new Mozilla brand which will roll out throughout 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The importance of usability activities in free open source software development has been acknowledged in the research literature and practice. However the decentralized and engineering-driven approach of open source projects can conflict with UX methodologies. As these cultures merge developers and designers may be exposed to situations where the values clash. We will review existing academic papers on UX in open source and discuss how these two philosophies can co-exist in OSS development and how designers can become part of the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source software has always been engineering driven. Most of the people building open source software are engineers with major turn on for features and more features which kind of explains how a lot of open source projects have rich and extremely important features but are a pain to see or work with. This talk aims to deal with this problem of designing in the open which is often neglected. Tools like GitHub, GitLab, etc. can actually become an arena for usability testing and give extremely promising output only if it follows an effective design process. This talk is also a practical guide for budding designers to get started with open source software.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Designers are not allergic to open source – it often is just quite difficult and frustrating to get involved. Gladly there are some easy methods to make UX &amp;amp; UI folks feel welcome and get them contributing! :)
This talk will show the methods we use at Nextcloud – which successfully helped us build an active and welcoming design team.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of these methods include:
- Describe clearly what your project does
- Being welcoming to designers
- Involving design from the start
- Using design tags in the issue tracker
- Have an easy landing page to get involved
- Cultivating a culture of design-driven decisions
- and more! :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We work to raise the profile of good design in open source software, and connect developers &amp;amp; designers to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that, we organize design tracks at well-known events like FOSDEM (hello ;) and FOSSASIA, have a job board to get designers involved, provide open design resources to developers &amp;amp; designers, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Getting HCI MSc students involved in open source software!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whats not to like!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I've had agreement from a university in London to propose a number open source software projects to a HCI masters programme for studnets to carry out usability evaluations as part of their MSc in HCI programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to do a short 10 maybe 15 mins proposal to members of established open source projects which would be able to take the feedback from "the top 2%" of student evaluations and incorporate them into their software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would outline what the criteria for the projects would be (still to be decided), and also what the students would do for the project and how they would send the recommendations to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, it's a gathering of interest exercise. It'll be super quick. Please accept me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd be happy to do this at the end of the day combined with something else if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open discussion about the design feedback process, gathering expectations and guidelines from different open source communities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every Open Source project is different, every developer and designer is different so hoping that this session would provide a magic answer to our questions is not realistic. Its purpose is to open the discussion and try to gather examples from different communities in the search of drawing some guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Open Source, the hardest part is to know when a design iteration should stop: after a certain amount of time, after a certain amount of votes, etc. Since there are no real/accountable stakeholders/decision-makers and the majority of decisions are done with voting, it can be hard for a designer to know which voices should be listened when iterating. Also, design is not really like code, so it can be harder to do partial work and just let another designer continue it. Sometimes things need to be redone from scratch (because of style differences, vision, approach, tools, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of giving and receiving feedback in open source should maximize the input all parties receive, having in mind their interests, availability, experience, commitment, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some questions we could ask:
- What can be done when we feel there is no consensus between designer and community or even between community members?
- What are the motives for proposing the design work and how much work does it involve?
- Should something be accepted just because it's the only proposal? Do we have the luxury to refuse design work?
- Should the same rules as in code review be applied?
- How do we better match designers and communities in terms of style?
- Should people from outside the community be involved in the feedback process?
- Are community members the target or representatives for their users?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting everyone's expectations needs a better communication and understanding of the topic and that's what this session tries to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There are many accessibility projects in the Open Source (OS) and Open Development (OD) space. Some focus on creating technologies designed to make the web easier for people with disabilities to use, others are exploring ways to make the web itself more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will look at a handful of projects including the Non Visual Desktop Access (NVDA) screen reader, Drupal Content Management System (CMS), Brunel Data Visualization, and other projects making a difference to accessibility, , and the accessibility of the OS/OD space itself.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;With a dedicated team of colleagues focused on various access needs and disabilities, we’ve designed a set of posters called Dos and Don’ts on Designing for Accessibility that aim to promote awareness of accessibility and various disabilities and conditions through good design practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve written a blog about these posters ( https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility ) explaining the collaborative design process behind them and sharing them on Twitter and GitHub. Since then, they have been seen and spread widely and have even been translated internationally. To date, we have French, Dutch, German and Chinese translations with more requests to translate them in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The posters have garnered a lot of attention on Twitter and GitHub with a few write-ups as well.  I’d like to share the experiences and challenges we faced in keeping these open: what format works best for our audience to be able to use and translate them in whatever platform or software they have? How do we deal with multiple translations in the same language? How do we encourage collaboration on them to promote further awareness? The recommendations, suggestions and feedback have been overwhelmingly positive and constructive which would not have happened had we not kept them open source.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;UX Design is often understood as creating an interface and testing if it is usable. But it can also include finding out what would be useful and serves users’ needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods to analyze user needs exits, however, they may assume a lot of resources or don’t consider community driven work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to demonstrate  methods we used for Wikidata and Mediawiki to
* research user needs
* use the findings to improve our software&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to particularly highlight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to do this with few resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to involve an open source community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to involve team members who are not designers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We hope to enable participants of the session to use the methods in their projects and communities and encourage to develop the methods further.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of humane interfaces is meeting the needs of a variety of people. They all have different skills, restrictions and whims. How do you figure out what exactly those are?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation I’ll talk about how I used user interviews and personas for that purpose, using them as tools for discussions and implementation of Public Transportation in GNOME Maps.
I'll talk about how I interviewed people from both cities and countryside, from both Brazil and Sweden, and how their insights challanged my own perceptions about what people need from a public transportation UI.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Numerous works of architecture, furniture, sculptures, illustrations and typography were made during the 1920s by a modernistic style called the Amsterdamse School. A lot of these works are not easily accessible and, even though preservation efforts are being taken, many are deteriorating over time. This talk will elaborate on how FOSS design and typographic tools were developed and used to digitise and extend a century old font under an OFL.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To aid the effort of preserving and reuse minimalistic – though often playful – designs from the early 20th century, Stichting z25.org ran a project where an sculpted incomplete typeface was digitised and made available as a font. The focus of this case study was on typographic design, FOSS development and co-funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project used contemporary cultural entrepreneurship by combining crowdfunding and public funding to finance this project. As a side-effect, the crowdfunding campaign contributed to local awareness about the existing cultural heritage and more insight to the amount of work required for typographical designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing a study of the original artist's works, a pipeline of several FOSS design tools was set up to meet this challenge. Graphviz was used to categorise and divide the design workload in infographics which also show character interdependencies. Additionally, we show how design work and collaboration can be managed more in Agile environments. The individual glyph designs were done in Inkscape and the font files were generated by using FontForge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FontForge offers sharing guides (lines supporting and accelerating the design process) amongst glyph designs, however Inkscape has no such facility as the individual SVG files are not synchronised for this. We developed a tool in Python to selectively synchronise guides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, z25.org will talk you through their adventure of funding, developing, digitising, designing and sharing. The result is a preserved and revitalised typeface called Neude that lay dormant for over a hundred years on impressive statues in the former post office in Utrecht, the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;I've been running a local meet-up centered around designing for FOSS and doing it thoroughly, choosing MuseScore as our first project. The meet-up has attracted people inexperienced with both UX design and scorewriting and it's been a good learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I'll talk about my experience with running a local meet-up, where we worked on designing MuseScore, an open-source scorewriting program, with a group of volunteers that had little to no prior experience with both the UX design process and with scorewriting. The design process we're going through is rigorous, including stakeholder and user research, persona creation, scenarios, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>GNOME Recipe App: From Thinking On to Acting On</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Open Source Design</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;GNOME Recipe App is all about food. We all love food. We want the recipe app to be community driven. GNOME people all over the world will be entering their favourite recipes and also they will be able to cook delicious things using the GNOME recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new idea. Looking all the way back to 2007, the idea of a GNOME cook book was already around (https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeCookbook). For one reason or another, we never quite got there. But the idea has stuck around.
With the upcoming 20th birthday of GNOME next year, we thought that we should make another attempt at this app, maybe as a birthday gift to all of us. Once we release the app, we will start to collect the content and print as a cookbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My talk will be shortly about how we decided to build the GNOME Recipe App as a community, how i started to work on mock-ups, how Jakub Steiner (design) designed them based on my mock-ups and how Matthias Clasen (engineering) implemented them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My real motivation with this talk to explain how we had fun while working on the app and encourage designers to contribute open source projects more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the demo video and landing page design on the files screen. Plus you can also visit our wiki page for more details. (https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Potential/Recipe%20App)&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I also want to talk about connecting the user experience, the technical requirements and the business requirements together is important in product discovery and development process. And for this, being a good communicator between teams in an organization is a key to make sure that everybody is on the same page.
Many designers divides up building a product into two distinct parts – design and development. There is always some technical questions I’m receiving from Matthias that can heavily influence my design decisions. Those questions should be asked and addressed as early as possible by talking with Matthias and Jakub. Recipe app starts and continues with discussions between design and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
In terms of interaction, visual design and implementation, details reveal themselves as the product is being built. Instead of handing off pixel-perfect designs to the team, it is far more better to design alongside them as we build it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will keep developing our app!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to see all delicious food recipes from all over the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to add recipes from my mum, grandmother&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to select my favourite recipes for later use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to see what ingredients are needed for the recipe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to see ingredients photo and explanations in the ingredients page from A to Z&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to keep track of what ingredients you’ve added and steps you’ve completed in each recipe by checking what you’ve done. I want to follow the cooking process from the beginning stage to the end stage. For example which stage I’m at now. Preparing the ingredients, which ingredients are put into the bowl… All things need to be checked when it’s completed. Timer should start when it is in the oven. preparation made simple with step-by-step instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I’m following a person I like, I want to see the other recipes he cooked, other recipes he favourited, his origin, his favourite foods (mentioning it by country or by ingredients)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the landing page I should see the recipes that matches the countries I choose, ingredients I choose and my favourites and the people I’m following&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want to print the recipes so I can put them on my fridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Make easy recipe adjustments with in substutions and conversions within each recipe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Non-Goals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We won’t build a web site. It will be only a GNOME app for GNOME community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There won’t be recipes from cookbooks (Copyright issues).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The day has been filled by designers doing all the talking, but here we switch and give the stage to software developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a chance to pitch your project to the designers in the room and ask them to contribute. You will be given some time to explain what your project is about, why it's important, and what design work needs to be done. No need to book in advance: just turn up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have done this session for the past 2 years, and everyboy seems to like it. So we are doing it again.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;How do we decide when a discussion is complete? How do we know we've heard from enough people, or that the topic isn't dead yet? Deciding how to take decisions in a community is hard - in this talk, I'd like to ways to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Figuring out when to close a discussion is really hard - and more so if all the participants are only using forums/mailinglists/chat rather than being face-to-face. Knowing that you've heard from the right people, trying to ensure quiet voices are heard, and making sure you're not cutting the discussion too early (or too late) really matters. In this "talk" I'd like to bring some examples of such discussions from our community (e.g. things which caused conflict, things which caused communications blocks, and so on), talk about how we handled them, and discuss ways in which we could improve - hopefully to the benefit of everyone present.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Surveillance: the case for personal Cloud and against GAFAMs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of Personal Cloud&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demonstrating a personal cloud instance and its innovative usage.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the Western population now uses 3 different kinds of computers: PCs, smartphones and Cloud services. Where is the room for Open Source and Free Software in this new world? Software freedom is possible on the PC side, it's already quite challenged on the smartphone world, and too little is being done on the Cloud side. A lot of Cloud services run on open source software, but offer in the end proprietary services that centralize user data. As Edward Snowden's revelations have demonstrated, all of this makes mass surveillance economically possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we do as a community to avoid mass surveillance? What alternative do we build?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possibility is the Personal Cloud movement, where a server (self-hosted or not) runs a platforms that enables personal data collection through connectors in order to run innovative apps relying on that personal data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this short presentation, we'll see how data centralization leads to mass surveillance and how a personal cloud works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>Showing to Caliopen's users how public their private messages are.</subtitle>
        <track>Decentralised Internet</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In order to help people keeping control over personal data, the Caliopen project intend to associate with each element of it's user interface, including messages, a "Privacy index" showing as precisely as possible how much that element is at risk of being publicly exposed. We will expose here our problems and leads.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The confidentiality of correspondence has been historically characterized by letter exchanges. Think of the stamped royal letter protected with a wax seal. Everyone knows that a letter mailed in a glued envelope is more private than a standard postcard. This confidentiality with easily-understood privacy indicators has disappeared with the advent of digital correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to offer the public a better control over their private life, Caliopen proposes to associate a "privacy index" indicator to each element of it's interface. The user will be able to easily improve the level indicated by this index and thus be encouraged to better protect themselves and their contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do so, we have to define precise metrics to calculate those indices, that rely as much on technical data (protocol used, encryption...) than on human behaviour. We intend to present how much ambitious this is, the difficulties we face, and the leads we follow to realize that particular goal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The future of decentralised communication, identity and reputation with Matrix</title>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The success of the decentralised internet depends on robust building blocks for decentralised identity, reputation and communication in general.  We'll look at how Matrix.org (an open standard for decentralised communication) is attacking these problems - both now and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Matrix is an open source project that publishes a standard and reference FOSS implementations for decentralised communication, primarily focusing on defragmenting all the various communication silos (messaging, VoIP, IoT etc) that users are trapped in today.  We believe that no single company or entity should ever have ownership or control a user's conversations - only the user themselves should have control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Matrix today rooms are replicated over all the servers which participate in a given conversation, decentralising by default similarly to Git or blockchain. Unlike other protocols, rooms have no single point of control on a given domain or entity and conversation history is shared equally over all participants.  However, user accounts themselves are currently bound to a single 'home server', meaning that users are currently tied to a single service provider, similarly to email or XMPP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll discuss Matrix's plans to decentralise accounts too - letting users share their account data across whatever sets of servers they trust; providing account portability as a matter of course.  We'll also discuss the related topic of decentralised identity - how to track how email addresses, phone numbers and other identifiers map to a given matrix user... without maintaining a centralised ID mapping database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll explore the critical topic of decentralised reputation.  Any decentralised system, whether it's Matrix, Email, XMPP, blockchain etc needs a way of tracking the relative reputation of the participants in the system in order to let users filter undesirable content.  We see this as the single biggest challenge remaining for Matrix, and one that is vital to the internet at large - helping users self-curate the content they consume and breaking free of the echo-chamber effect of centralised services.  We'll talk about the options we've been looking at with Matrix, and issue a call to arms for the whole community to work on solving this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The internet started as a decentralized network based on Open Standards. Back then everybody could set up his own web server, mail server or news server and communicate with the rest of the world. The last years we saw, that for many users the internet was reduced to a few centralized services used to connect with their friends, to communicate and to store and share all kind of data. Nextcloud wants counteract this development for people who want to store, sync and share their data. It provides a cloud platform based on Open Standards and Free Software. To connect the nodes of self-hosted cloud platforms, Nextcloud is the driving force behind the concept of Cloud Federation. The aim is to provide a Open Standard to share data across multiple cloud servers. At the moment this protocol is not only implemented by Nextcloud but also by Pydio and ownCloud. Together with many partners, Nextcloud works on formalizing the protocols to create a real standard. This talk want to discuss how to restore a free, decentralized and open internet in the area of data sync and share.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet started as a decentralized network based on Open Standards. Back then everybody could set up his own web server, mail server or news server and communicate with the rest of the world. The last years we saw, that for many users the internet was reduced to a few centralized services used to connect with their friends, to communicate and to store and share all kind of data. This lecture looks at this development from the perspective of a cloud platform which enables people to store, share and sync all kind of data. In this area we saw already the last years a strong push to more decentralized solution, developed as Free Software. This was a important step in the right direction, but at the same time it created a new problem. Everybody who set up his own cloud platform can only collaborate with users on the same server. It become obvious that we need a way to connect all this clouds again. Like with email, for example, it shouldn't make a difference if you communicate with someone on the same server or not. In order to build this bridge, a concept called Cloud Federation was introduced. The aim is to provide a Open Standard to share data across multiple cloud servers. At the moment this protocol connects all Nextcloud, Pydio and ownCloud users. Today Nextcloud is the driving force behind this development and work actively with many partners on formalizing the protocol in order to create a real Open Standard.
This talk wants to discuss the development in the world of cloud platforms and how Nextcloud can help to restore a free, decentralized and open internet in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It is probably unnecessary to explain the perils of a GAFAM centralized web in this devroom. But we offer the idea that recentralizing one's data into a personal cloud allows for MORE than only privacy.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In today's web our data are kept into silos. Several companies each own a fragment of one's digital identity. Google has the emails, Facebook has friends pictures, mobile providers have a timeline of my location, my events are so mixed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As FOSS developer, it is our responsibility to provide an open-source alternative to these. But convincing friends and families of the importance of it is not easy, an it is not possible to replace a network-effect system by just doing an open source alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We posit a possible first step is to move (or at least copy) our data from the cloud, aka someone's else computer, back to one's computer. And then to use all this data comming from different sources to create mashups that silos cannot provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will create one such use case, from retrieving some data from a provider, mashing it up against some of user's data and providing a new usage. This app is made as a simple web app, installable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For many of us, Internet access seems to be naturally
given, but unfortunately in Germany it is still a privilege. This is
sad, even the European Court of Human Rights and the European Council
ackknowledged: Internet Access is Human Right. In Germany Freifunk
activists and initiatives enabled people to access internet and
communication, education and information sources in more than 400
facilities since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;freifunk.net means more than 15 years of social and technical
innovation in free community networks. Beside Germany there are similar
projects in more than 30 countries living these ideas. By sharing
knowledge on how to build free community networks, freifunk delivers
impulses against digital divide and for free internet access.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://guifi.net/en/"&gt;guifi·net&lt;/a&gt; is a technological, social and economic project built by citizens, which centers its activity in the field of telecommunications. Its purpose is to enable broadband Internet access for everybody, with high quality and for a fair price, by means of developing a telecommunications network based in a model of commons, open, neutral and with unencumbered access. The network counts with &lt;a href="https://guifi.net/ca/node/2413/view/map"&gt;more than 32,000 nodes&lt;/a&gt; and gives access to an estimated 50,000 people, mostly in Catalonia and the Valencian Country. guifi.net counts on a diverse community of individuals, organizations, companies and public administrations agreeing upon a &lt;a href="https://guifi.net/en/FONNC"&gt;common license&lt;/a&gt;, with the support of a &lt;a href="https://fundacio.guifi.net/"&gt;private foundation&lt;/a&gt; that watches over its development and integrity. guifi.net enables a collaborative economy where volunteers and businesses contribute to the development of the common network thanks to governance tools like the compensations system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the main issue with centralized internet services is the commercial exploitation of people private datas, and the relative lack of security of those data against states actors among others. Yet, being self hosted and using smaller provider do not automatically grant protection, and few people do have a concrete idea of what steps are needed to efficiently protect the privacy of others when hosting services, inspired by the policy of Mozilla, riseup and several others groups trying to do the right things&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will mostly speak of the steps required for respecting privacy, with a focus on privacy beyond "The NSA is trying to catch me", showing how even the best intentions do result in problem for some users, and how sysadmins and activists can set their systems to protect users without burdening them, and how things are most often more subtle than we think, in the context of hosting services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <subtitle>FLOSS: Positive Alternatives to Big-Data centralized Services</subtitle>
        <track>Decentralised Internet</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Big data companies (aka GAFAM) have centralized our services, our data and our digital lives.
Over the last two years, the French non-profit organization Framasoft has been demonstrating that FLOSS can be used as an ethical and user-respecting alternative to widespread services such as Dropbox, Skype, Facebook, Google Agenda, or even Minecraft.
Time has now come to share this experience so that it can spread into a network of data-friendly and user-respectful service hosters.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;2016 is a milestone: Google Apple Facebook Amazon and Microsoft (also known as GAFAM) are now ranked as the 5 largest companies by market capitalization in the USA. Big Data has become more important and powerful than Big Oil or Big Pharma. Web centralization, profiling advertisement, government enablement to carry out mass-surveillance, shrinking diversity and innovation, and even bevahioural hijacking: here are only a few of the numerous issues that arise with these huge centralizede powers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though a wider audience is becoming aware of these issues, their answer is always the same: "What else can I use?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Framasoft is a small French non-profit association whose aim is to promote Free-Libre software and culture to the general public through practical projects: a Free-Libre software directory, a user-friendly USB stick filled with portable FLOSS, a publishing house for Free-Libre books…
In October 2014, we made public this impossible challenge: over the next 3 years, we would provide Mr. and Mrs. Everyone with more than 30 alternatives to the main GAFAM services, all based upon Free-Libre and Open-Source softwares while respecting the users privacy. We aimed at a triple goal : to inform the general audience of the stakes, to provide viable alternative as a proof of concept to mainstream users, and to spread this experience by promoting self-hosting and helping other data-friendly services hosters to grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than two years later, a wider audience is being aware of the data-centralization issues. We are on track to win our bet since only a few services remain to be launched. We are currently initiating CHATONS, a network bringing together hosters who respect privacy and provide ethical services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the story of what we did and how we did it. We would be thrilled if our experience could be useful to non-French speaking projects and communities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Free Software on the desktop was cool in the 2000s, but nowadays, we need FLOSS as a Service.
If you go to dropbox, you signup with your email/password, boom, you get your cloud.
If you go to Nextcloud.com, the call to action is "download".
We'll never reach the 99%, we need a signup button on every free software landing page.
libre.sh is paving the way toward that direction. The first step is to have an infrastructure to orchestrate these softwares.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During this presentation, I'll show you how we leverage the power of docker to manage hundreds of containers that deliver FLOSS as a Service for the 99%.
I'll quickly explain why we choose docker.
Then, I'll dive into showing, live, how to setup a full server with:
 - HAProxy with let's encrypt
 - Rocket.Chat
 - GitLab
 - ELK (for log collection)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all in less than 20 minutes. So then, you have no excuses to not host free software for you and/or your organization :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;libre.sh in numbers:
 - installed on 5 servers (4 different organizations) (that I know)
 - running hundreds of containers
 - offering 24 different applications (chat, git, cloud, mail...)
 - with a wide range of different stacks (MySQL, Postgres, Mongo, PHP, Ruby, NodeJS...)
 - and 4 modules (log collection, monitoring, backups, proxy)
 - developped since 2 years&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenWISP2 is a simple web app composed of several reusable python libraries and django apps.
Having learnt from the experience with OpenWISP1, the new version of the controller has been redesigned to be more flexible, reusable, modularly built and easier to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its goal is to make it easier to maintain a network of devices based on OpenWRT/LEDE.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Current features&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configuration management for embedded devices supporting different firmwares: OpenWRT/LEDE and OpenWISP Firmware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;support for additional firmware can be added by specifying custom backends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configuration editor based on JSON-Schema editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;advanced edit mode: edit NetJSON DeviceConfiguration objects for maximum flexibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configuration templates: reduce repetition to the minimum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configuration context: reference ansible-like variables in the configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simple HTTP resources: allow devices to automatically download configuration updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VPN management: easily create VPN servers and clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Project goals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;automate configuration management for embedded devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;allow to minimize repetition by using templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make it easy to integrate in larger django projects to improve reusability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make it easy to extend its models by providing abstract models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide ways to support more firmwares by adding custom backends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep the core as simple as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide ways to extend the default behaviour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encourage new features to be published as extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The ultimate aim is to achieve greater decentralization of federated services, such as social networking, file sharing, blog or email, on the net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many people are looking at containers as a way to run massive applications, automatically scaling to millions of users, Puffin allows running many independent personal lightweight applications on a single physical machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the project is a specialized application catalog for Docker, with easy to use interface à la app store, that can be easily run on a personal server. The second part is a common hosting platform which allows running limited number of applications for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the presentation I will introduce the ideas behind the project and show a demo.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The difference between Puffin and other container management and hosting services such as Docker Cloud or Rancher, is that the applications are curated to achieve optimal efficiency on a small scale and the interface is more friendly towards an average computer user. Docker was chosen as container technology due to its popularity - more and more web applications are providing Dockerfile or even docker-compose.yml themselves, so it's not very difficult to adapt them to include in the package repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting multiple containers on a single machine to reduce hosting costs implies multi-tenancy. Although Docker is not fully secure against accessing host system from a container, I believe the situation will improve in the future or alternatively another container technology will be used for Puffin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FreedomBox is a consumer device that aims to facilitate free
communication among people, safely and securely, in a world where our
fundamental rights are under grave threat.  FreedomBox will put in
people's own hands and under their own control encrypted voice and text
communication, anonymous publishing, social networking, media sharing,
and (micro)blogging.  It is built on top of Debian and is currently
available for several single board computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is aimed at introducing FreedomBox, its goals, current status
and future plans.  It is also a call for help.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Decentralization of the Internet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic human communication is getting more and more online.  Many of us
probably already communicate more on the Internet than offline.  The
communication media are often controlled by few corporate entities who
hold immense power.  This power that they continue to accumulate is
often abused to the determent of their users.  Instead of building and
relying such centralized entities, we need to build an Internet that is
more decentralized and controlled by the people using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FreedomBox&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people often believe that there is no alternative to using
centralized services like Gmail and Facebook.  A global network of
volunteers are building software that will put back control of
communications back into people's hands.  In many areas, such software
exists but is not easy to use.  FreedomBox project aims to build a
consumer device that brings these decentralized technologies together
for easy usage and maintenance by typical users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruben Lubbes has been working with and participating in the project for years,
mainly working on translations, product development and persona's.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many people learn to code because they want to write a computer game. More often than not, they want to re-write their favourite game, but making it a little easier! Unfortunately the gap between a personal project, open source game, and professional offering is substantial, with the lack of polish obvious at every turn. In this talk, Steven Goodwin, a game developer of 20 years standing (and 3 books on the subject), dissects each discipline (art, music, writing, and code) to explain where polish should be added and why it’s so rare to see open source games as effective as their commercial counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In theory, an open source game should be much better than a commercial version. After all, as a group, we have more resources at our disposal, over more time, in order to build more assets, write more code, and fix more bugs. But that’s rarely true. Our efforts look rushed and amateur in comparison. After a brief discussion on the meta-problems of open source game development we look at each discipline and demonstrate what needs to be written to improve the game, details of simple, but effective, visual improvements that can be done with very little effort, and how certain functionality can be implemented in order to make a game shine. The talk also includes a checklist of features implemented in Space Bounce that, while you might not have noticed them, you would certainly realize if they weren’t there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The case of rapid prototyping of a small prototype for a server backend of a geolocation-based mobile game, using nginx, OpenResty, Redis and Docker will be examined in the talk. Topics will include: why was the technology stack selected, what are the advantages (and some disadvantages), the architecture of the prototype, and how the features of the stack were used in the implementation. Some words will be said on how to keep iterations on the prototype rapid and how to upgrade the project from the prototype to a production system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Introduction to Computer Vision via WebCam game example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try WebCam game during presentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand, how motion detection works with the help of &lt;code&gt;OpenCV&lt;/code&gt; libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand, the problem of low lighting and noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hear real-world example of using WebCam games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fork and create your own WebCam game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;P.S. Game is written by the speaker and source/documentation would be published, after talk is accepted ;)&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should attend&lt;/strong&gt;
* &lt;em&gt;[Mostly]&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Software developers&lt;/strong&gt;, especially with the background of &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; or willing to learn &lt;code&gt;OpenCV&lt;/code&gt; – because speaker would be illustrating principles, how his game works, so later you could (fork and) create your own version.
* &lt;strong&gt;Project managers and entrepreneurs&lt;/strong&gt;, because real-world business cases would be discussed
* &lt;strong&gt;Bored people&lt;/strong&gt;, who just want some interactive game during the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back-story for the presentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colleague from HR: &lt;em&gt;I found a video about augmented gaming climbing wall, would it be hard to implement something like it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well... I was playing with similar technology some time ago&lt;/em&gt; – answered. Found my &lt;strong&gt;6 years old project&lt;/strong&gt; and to my surprise – it &lt;strong&gt;was still working&lt;/strong&gt; (actually spent about an hour to install dependencies and fix &lt;code&gt;include&lt;/code&gt; values). That is what &lt;em&gt;backward-compatible&lt;/em&gt; open source software really means :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WebCam based games still gives &lt;em&gt;WOW&lt;/em&gt; effect&lt;/strong&gt; (still trending, still looks new). &lt;strong&gt;But why it is not mainstream after 6 years?&lt;/strong&gt; To answer that question, lets dig into some implementation and bussiness use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content of the presentation/DEMO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;: LIVE demonstration of WebCam based game: Yes – audience could play from their seats by moving their hands :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business case&lt;/strong&gt;: Why not mass production? Example: advertisement for IT recruitment in conferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation details&lt;/strong&gt;: rocket science or comparing pixels (visual debugging info would be shown, while others are playing)? The problem of lighting and noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion/question&lt;/strong&gt;: Why not mainstream: hardware problems, trend to (not) learn &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt;, difficulty of &lt;code&gt;OpenGL&lt;/code&gt; lighting (if there would not be other questions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Draw, play, erase, correct, scan &amp;amp; play anew!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will share our experience in designing games that revolve around interactive drawings (felt pen on paper, graff on walls, colored syrup on waffles...). How does such games work? First a camera captures the drawing, then we analyze it, use that information in our game, then we project back the rendered game on the drawing to close the loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we will discuss the implications of such an analogical and free-form input in term of user experience and possible gameplays. Then we will present the tech we have been developing to ease the development process. This implied working both on software (a library, the PTX system) and hardware (a kit for easy setup).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The openEMSstim, a hardware board based on an Arduino Nano that modulates the amplitude of Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) signals.  These muscle stimulation signals can be used for games, interactive art, etc. The approach is based on medical rehabilitation hardware and openEMSstim makes it approachable for researchers to use it safely. The project aims at providing a comprehensible and open-source starting point to experiment with muscle stimulation and learn how to keep it safe. openEMSstim provides not only hardware but also the software that communicates with the board and controls it (for Unity3d, Python, Processing, Android and Node.Js). This board is controllable via Bluetooth and compatible with any BLE device (such as your smartphone) or controllable via USB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project is fully accessible at: https://github.com/PedroLopes/openEMSstim&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The openEMSstim has been created in collaboration between Pedro Lopes (at Hasso Plattner Institute / University of Potsdam) and Max Pffeifer Leibnitz University in Hannover (responsible for the original version). The openEMSstim has been used in the ACM UIST'16 conference by 20 teams of students that used it to create innovative prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;The openEMSstim is also a project that aims at informing people on how to build such devices. Rather than building devices by hacking existing devices or building dangerous circuits from scratch, we intentionally designed it in a way that it recycles existing medical stimulators, which are safe to use. This way, the openEMSstim is actually just a big (wireless and cool) potentiometer that adjusts the intensity of the medical devices stimuli. The project keeps on growing and aims at finding new form-factors, smaller PCB, simpler hardware components, wifi integration, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Open source games are even more open source if not only the source of the game engine itself is available, but also all the other assets, such as sprites, samples, soundtracks et cetera also have their source available. What is source in the context of multimedia assets? And how can we create those assets in a more source-like way?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will briefly point out the importance of source code, and why this is also important for multimedia assets. I will show some file types, and discuss whether or not they are source, and if not what would be their source. Finally, I'll give a real example of creating music in the way a programmer would write C or Python code, and compile the source of this music with a makefile into an Ogg Vorbis file. I hope this will bring more awareness about the need for source code of multimedia to game developers, and hopefully it will inspire others, including programmers that think they are not artistic, to create those assets, to share them, and to be able to learn from and modify them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the IncLudo project, we are making open source games to promote diversity in the workplace. After a year of building and testing game prototypes, we want to share what we've learned about bias, empathy, icebreakers, taboos, and board games while pursuing this important but challenging goal.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Hellink is an educational video game about information literacy. Being produced by an university library, it heavily focuses on the business model of scientific information, and the various ways to promote more freedom in this domain, especially Open Data. Discover the creative process behind the project, and how to raise awareness about complex subjects through videogames!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The project was launched by the Library of the Université Pierre et Marie Curie, which is the biggest scientific university in France. We had multiple goals: create a "real" game, with engaging gameplay, artistic direction and storyline; teach the basics of information literacy and train the audience's critical eye; raise awareness about the business of scientific information and Open Data, which is the heart of our theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will work from a few questions helping us to understand, from both a diplomatic and a creative point of view, how to effectively engage the audience with Open Data through the means of videogames: how to create an "activist" game into the constrained context of a public institution, especially a university with commercial links with some of the entities criticised by the game? And how to speak about complex subjects with video games: what can be expected and what shouldn't?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video game can be a powerful tool, if well handled! Come talk with us to understand together how to better use it for promoting open data!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Tablexia is an app for children with dyslexia in secondary schools available for free in Czech, Slovak and German language for iOS and Android. Tablexia aims to support the development of cognitive abilities (e. g. working memory, spatial orientation, phonological discrimination).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Tablexia is an educational app for children with dyslexia in secondary schools. The results of dyslexia are problems with reading and writing. It is caused by weakened cognitive abilities such as a working memory, attention, spatial orientation or phonological processing. Tablexia aims to support the development of those abilities, which can help to improve the reading and writing skills.
Tablexia is an open source game developed by the CZ.NIC association. It is available on Google Play and App Store for free in Czech, Slovak and German language.
The app contains 8 games. Each focuses on one of the cognitive abilities. All the games are connected with a detective theme. Young detective learns how to become an expert in chasing the robbers or remembering the right order of the sounds from a crime scene.
A part of the app is also an Encyclopedia, where kids can learn about dyslexia and find useful tips how to overcome the troubles by reading and writing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"Snap is Scheme disguised as Scratch"&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Snap is the programming language used in UC Berkeley’s introductory CS course named “The Beauty and Joy of Computing” (BJC). As part of the BJC curriculum, Snap is currently being disseminated nationwide across the U.S. to support the new AP CS-Principles course created by the College Board. The NSF has awarded longstanding grants to bring Snap and BJC to every high school in New York City, the largest school district in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snap is Scheme disguised as Scratch, a free and open web browser based visual programming language aiming to support a technically rigorous introductory CS curriculum at the college and high school level. Snap has been translated into 39 languages and is used around the world, both as a teaching environment and in research projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snap borrows from Scratch its graphical LEGO blocks grammar and its 2D cartoon themed microworld around a stage with sprite actors, costumes, events, and parallelism, combining it with Scheme’s dynamically typed and lexically scoped variables, first-class lists, lambda (closures), first-class continuations and proper tail recursion, encouraging programmers to create their own control structures (loops, catch/throw, higher-order functions such as map/filter/reduce) tail recursively without having to worry about stack overflows. Snap supports nested sprites and lets programmers turn arbitrary JavaScript code into graphical blocks. Its “codification” mechanism can transcompile graphical scripts into arbitrary textual code, offering a two-way transition between blocks and text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snap is implemented in JavaScript using HTML5 APIs. It has been renamed from BYOB to Snap since version 4.0. Snap’s development has been supported by two NSF grants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Polymorph, a libre videogame platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We produce art installation and video games using a tailor-made libre game engine based on Ogre3D (visuals) and Puredata (sounds).&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Polymorph has been started in July 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first projects we are working is Tuning Game, in collaboration with Contredanse asbl, and PEEL, a 3d puzzle game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is open to visual artists, designers, academics, musicians, developers et enthusiasts focused on experimental video games, programming and interactive applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a place dedicated to exploration of video game medium, aesthetically, theorically, artistically and technically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also careful about the influence of the tools on the work we do. Therefore, we choosed to work with a libre software suite, including blender, gimp and inkscape for content creation and Ogre3D, Puredata, Bullet and other libraries for the game engine. Other libre engines are welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are providing the game engine as a complete package, ready to install with installation procedure and examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Escoria, a libre point'n'click framework using Godot Engine</title>
        <subtitle>"Oh, it looks just like SCUMM!" -- Tim Schafer</subtitle>
        <track>Open Game Development</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Godot community has released a full-featured point'n'click adventure game framework based on Godot Engine. It is fully open source (MIT licensed) and comes with a great open source manual and demo game written by Ariel Manzur, the Escoria creator, and the FLOSS Manuals FR community. This presentation aims at showcasing Escoria, its features and the basics of using it, to give attendants a good starting point for creating their own point'n'click games.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Back when they kickstarted their Godot Engine-powered point'n'click adventure game &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/330420/"&gt;The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça and Pizzaboy&lt;/a&gt;, its developers had promised that they would release the framework they developed under a free and open source license. This finally happened in October 2016, after some important refactoring to make it suitable for any kind of point'n'click game. At the same time, a great open source manual and demo game (see links) were released, written by Ariel Manzur, the Escoria creator, and the FLOSS Manuals FR community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free and open source world has therefore an advanced point'n'click framework at the ready with both source code, demos and documentation, only waiting for game designers and artists to create awesome adventure games (both open source and proprietary, the engine license is not restrictive). To give an idea of the tool's maturity, Tim Schafer of LucasArts and Double Fine Productions said of it, when visiting the developers of The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça and Pizzaboy, that "it looks just like SCUMM!" (the engine used by LucasArts for their classic adventure games). Escoria is based on the 2D and 3D Godot game engine, and can thus leverage many features that are not common in point'n'click adventure games, which allows for the creation of interesting hybrid genres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, we will showcase the features of Escoria, how to setup a new project with it and use its scripting language to create classic point'n'click scenes. Basic knowledge of Godot's interface is not mandatory, as we will try to explain also what features are specific to Escoria and which ones are specific to Godot. The presentation will reuse elements of the existing manual and demo in attempt to be as clear as possible, and to allow attendants to continue their discovery of Escoria using resources they are already familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) is an optimization technique which uses information about the runtime profile of an application. PGO is an area of active development in LLVM. In this talk I discuss how PGO was implemented in LDC, the LLVM-based D compiler, and which speedup the use of PGO can give.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) is an optimization technique which uses information about the runtime profile of an application. The binary of an application is instrumented to collect data like number of times a function is called.
This additional information is used to apply advanced optimizations to the application. PGO is an area of active development in LLVM.
A recent update of LDC, the LLVM-based D compiler, is able to use PGO. In this talk I discuss which additonal IR code must be generated for PGO and how it was implemented in LDC. I also show the effect of PGO on a test application and the compiler itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;LLVM has a great track record for being able to target a large range of processors, both large 32/64-bit devices and deeply embedded 8/16-bit processors. From most perspectives, from Clang through to code generation, the size of most operations do not make much difference to the ease of implementation. However there are some assumptions that are baked deeply into the compiler; one of which is the memory access width, more specifically that it is addressible in 8-bit words. This however is not always the case, many embedded DSPs can only access memory with 16-bit addressibility, and trying to teach LLVM about this proves to be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will present our first explorations in this area, and share our thoughts on how we can make LLVM more memory agnostic for all targets with non-8-bit memory.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;ESBMC is a SMT-based context-bounded bounded model checker that aims to provide bit-precise verification of both ANSI-C and C++ programs. The presentation will briefly introduce the tool and then show the usage of libtooling as a frontend for the tool, including the problems we had during the development and what we hope for the future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On the first half of the talk, I'll describe the tool and present some examples of its usage, including the verification of concurrent programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll then focus on the tool's new frontend, which generates the AST of the program using clang's libtooling and converts it to an internal format that's used for the verification. This second half of the presentation will be focused on the development of the C frontend and the yet to be C++ frontend, including how we had to adjust to the libtooling API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the talk is to present the difficulties that we faced when moving away from our frontend to clang, including limitations we found during the development. I'll end the talk with what we hope for the future, as users of clang, which translates to easier access to some of clang's internals (specially the static analyser).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Last year, at the 2016 LLVM dev room, I presented ideas on how to
improve LNT to make performance tracking of LLVM generated code
easier. We've implemented most ideas since, and we're happy to see that
our ideas work out in practice: quite often, understanding the root
cause for a performance regression now takes about 5 to 10 minutes of
work, whereas before it typically took us half a day to produce all
data that is now recorded automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intend to give a demo of how we use LNT at ARM's LLVM teams.  I'll
also discuss how LNT is useful for other projects that need to track
performance of generated code. LNT is starting to be used by at least
also some GCC, java jit and even a Verilog-to-C++ compiler teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll also give the necessary pointers on what you need to get
started on LNT for your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find a preview of the kind of things I plan to demo at
http://blog.llvm.org/2016/06/using-lnt-to-track-performance.html&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For decades developers try to build a bug free software. Numerous techniques and metrics were developed. However, there is still a need in an approach that can both assert program domain and provide some reliable metrics. And such approach exists. It is called Mutation Testing. Here is a brief overview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a function and a test for that function. Any semantic change in the function (so called 'mutant') should break the test ('kill mutant'). If that's not the case, then mutant is considered as survived.
No mutants should survive ever. If they are, then either the test is bad or the function is not correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research in this area exists since 70's. However, this approach is not widely adopted. The computational cost is one of the blockers. Another one, is the way such systems are implemented: most of them do mutations at the AST level, hence they are tightly coupled to the particular languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to present you Mull: our implementation of Mutation Testing system. We use JIT and runtime compilation to speedup the system and make it accessible for everyday usage. Besides that we go down to the IR level, making the system applicable for any LLVM-based language such as C, C++, Rust, Objective-C, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Security is an every increasing concern across the computing industry, most recently in the emerging Internet of Things market. The compiler is the one tool that sees just about every piece of code, and is a position to both check for security and improve security. LLVM cannot magically write secure code, but it can help a professional programmer write really good secure code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will introduce our joint research program with Bristol University to add such features to LLVM. This project is still in its early stages, but we will present our initial work and discuss our future plans. A particular goal is community feedback on the priorities for this research program.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Security is an every increasing concern across the computing industry, most recently in the emerging Internet of Things market. LLVM cannot magically write secure code, but it can help a good programmer write secure code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Leakage Aware Design Automation project is an EPSRC funded programme running over four years at Bristol University led by Elizabeth Oswald and Dan Page. It is looking at how all aspects of software tooling can improve security of systems, particularly by minimizing information leakage. An important part of this project is extending compiler technology, and the programme includes a postdoctoral post to research this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embecosm are the "industrial supporters" of this project. Our role is to take the research ideas and make them work in real compilers - including LLVM. Some of this will be about guiding the programmer - warning of coding styles that are insecure. The other part of the project is providing assistance to the programmer in implementing advanced cryptographic techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the areas the compiler can warn about are related to information leakage which can be detected by variation in power usage, program timing or memory access. Where we see control flow, cycle times or memory accesses which depend on critical variables (such as cryptographic keys). Such variables can be marked with a "sensitive" attribute and the compiler warn if they or their aliases are involved in control flow, impact cycle timing or affect memory access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a great many techniques that users can adopt to make their code more secure. Some of these are straightforward for the compiler to implement. For example ensuring that critical functions clear their stack frame on return or longjmp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not difficult to slice the top off a memory chip and use a scanning electron microscope to read values. A (relatively) easy way to scan for candidate cryptographic keys. Bit-splitting defends against this, but scattering individual bits of critical values throughout memory, combining them on the fly for a calculation and scattering them back out to memory. By hand this is laborious in the extreme, but the compiler can reduce this to a simple "bit-split" attribute on a variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other attacks use intense radiation to disrupt a processor or memory. The hope is that a critical variable will be impacted. To fix this, code will often repeat important operations. A standard compiler optimizer will promptly remove such operations, so such code is used unoptimized. But it would be much better to tell the compiler which bits of code to leave in place. Or even better to identify code at danger and let the compiler insert the duplicate operations automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other techniques which we hope to explore in this project, including
- atomicity - balancing control flow paths to minimize information leakdave
- shuffling - varying the time at which particular instructions are executed
- algorithmic variation - using different algorithms at random to perform operations.
- machine learning and superoptimization to minimize information leakage?
- automated identification of instruction set extensions to improve cryptographic robustness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these techniques are not new, but none are yet in mainstream compilers. We plan to add these features and new ideas which our academic colleagues are researching. The project is still in its early stages and the purpose of this talk is to raise awareness and get community feedback on some of the areas we will be working on, and suggestions for other areas to consider.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;convergent&lt;/code&gt; function attribute has been in LLVM for some time now to model restrictions e.g. on barrier intrinsics for GPUs. Recently, we've become aware of some additional restrictions that are required for the arguments of certain intrinsics in GPU code. The use of the &lt;code&gt;convergent&lt;/code&gt; attribute on function parameters has been proposed for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will give an overview over the last 2 years of the GStreamer project and gives an outlook into the future. It is targeted at both application developers and anyone interested in multimedia on the Linux desktop and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GStreamer is a highly versatile plugin-based multimedia framework that caters to a whole range of multimedia needs, whether desktop applications, streaming servers or multimedia middleware; embedded systems, desktops, or server farms. It is also cross-platform and works on Linux, *BSD, Solaris, macOS, Windows, iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the last GStreamer status updated at FOSDEM in 2014, there were 4 new major releases of GStreamer, packed with lots of new features and other improvements for everybody, making the life of application developers, GStreamer plugin developers and also end-users easier and hopefully better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us to find out more and why you should care!&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>Dissecting media file formats with Kaitai Struct</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Open Media</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Media file formats grow progressively more and more complex every year and supporting them all requires tremendous effort of all the FOSS developers. It's a problem that concerns not only low-level library developers, but higher level software as well: for example, audio sequencer or video editor developer will still need solid understanding of underlying media file format structure to be able to debug any problems with it (like non-standard chunks inserted by some properitary software). We'd want to present Kaitai Struct, a new free/open source solution for file format dissecting, visualization and parsing. It is "write one - run everywhere" solution, where one needs to specify declarative file format spec once, and then compile it into ready-made parsing library in a large variety of supported target languages. And our visualization tools make Kaitai Struct work like "Wireshark for media files".&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kaitai Struct started as an in-house tool in 2014 and was initially released as open-source project to public at March-April, 2016, supporting only 2 target languages: Java and Ruby. Since then, we've collected almost 350 stars a GitHub, hundreds of praising testimonials, got about a dozen of contributors, implemented support for 8 languages, got a handful of useful tools, like console visualizer, GUI visualizer, &lt;a href="https://kt.pe/kaitai_struct_webide/"&gt;Web IDE&lt;/a&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaitai Struct is frequently compared to proprietary template-enabled hex editors (like 010 Editor, Synalize It! or Hexinator), but goes one step forward: it's not only about highlighting entities in hex dump, but also it can automatically generate working API from spec, which accelerates work of file formats considerably and greatly reduces human factor errors when developing parsers by hand. One's guaranteed to get exactly the same parsing result both in visualizer and using the compiled API. And, what's important, it's free and open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other comparable projects include BinPAC (but it's C++ only), Preon (which is Java-only), PADS (which targets only C &amp;amp; Haskell), and Construct (Python only). In comparison, Kaitai Struct offers cross-language support, and includes visualization tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For media file dissection, we have a growing collection of well-known media file formats (including MP4 / QuickTime .mov, AVI, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc), and other interesting file formats (like executables, byte-code, network protocols, etc, etc). We hope that open media software developers would find Kaitai Struct to be a helpful ally in their arsenal of tools to deal with the diverse world of modern file formats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;For a long time the multimedia world has had to pay attention to whom the intellectual property of a codec or tool belonged to such that they could pay royalties for each and every device or program using it. In 2012 the standardization of Opus changed that for audio through the combined effort of several individuals who were part of the free software community and large companies bringing together their research and patents and offering it for free use by everyone. By avoiding existing patents, interesting new techniques for efficient audio compression were invented.
Now, in the effort to make a royalty free video codec in the same spirit as Opus, even more companies have joined into the "Alliance for Open Media" organization, with its first codec titled "AV1". Starting from the codebase of Google's VP9 codec, AV1 has currently over 45 experimental coding tools contributed by its member companies with the hopes that many will make it into the final version of the codec. This talk will serve as an update to the overall progress of the codec as well as to briefly explain the principles of operation of several coding tools expected to make it into the final version.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Note: here AES refers to the Audio Engineering Society, not the Advanced Encryption Standard.
The growing field of pro-audio networking has recently seen demand for movement away from proprietary technologies towards open standards. One of the most significant resulting standards is AES67 which covers high quality audio transport over IP networks. This talk covers the motivations driving the standardization efforts and the basic details of the standard itself.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, the use of IP networks for pro-audio has seen significant growth. These networks transport high quality uncompressed audio at low latency and they have been adopted in situations ranging from studios to churches to TV broadcasts. While this field has been dominated by proprietary technologies such as Dante and Ravenna, there is now a growing interest in moving to open standards driven by a need for compatibility and interoperability. This talk covers one of the standards resulting from this effort: AES67 for audio transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AES67 standard is designed for low latency transport of uncompressed audio between different audio networking systems. This requires both a means of transporting the audio data and a sample-accurate clock synchronization mechanism; there is low tolerance for glitches or playout jitter. This clocking requirement distinguishes AES67 from other streaming systems which can accept artifacts or latency from jitter-buffers.
The approach taken to the AES67 standard has been to use an agreed set of existing protocols, no new protocols are defined by the standard. Media transport is handled by RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol), clock synchronization by the Precision Time Protocol (IEEE 1588-2008) and session information by SDP. Additional requirements are specified for each of these protocols; profiles that must be supported, sample formats etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Note: here AES refers to the Audio Engineering Society, not the Advanced Encryption Standard.
The growing field of pro-audio networking has recently seen demand for movement away from proprietary technologies towards open standards. AES70 has emerged as a means to control audio devices over the network. This talk covers the motivations driving the standardization efforts and the basic details of the standard itself.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, the use of IP networks for pro-audio has seen significant growth. These networks incorporate many types of audio devices, from input amplifiers to full mixing desks. Recently, there has been interest in moving to an open standard to control these devices. This has resulted in the AES70 standard which addresses device control with a focus on audio specific controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AES70, or Open Control Architechture (OCA), is a device control protocol designed for audio and video devices. It is particularly focused on robustness and device compatibility. The protocol defines a mechanism for modelling a media device as a set of component objects with methods, properties and events. A rich set of component objects is defined in the standard including switches, filters and delay lines. Additional object types can be defined using single inheritence, allowing for custom versions of built in objects. These components can be grouped into functional blocks and linked to indicate the signal flow through the device. All this descriptiveness allows generic control panel applications to accurately represent controlled devices.
While the initial AES70 standard does define a TCP based protocol for control communications, the device modelling layer is designed to be able to sit on any number of protocols. Additional proposed protocols include a UDP based implementation for small devices and a USB transport mechanism allowing direct control from a computer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;An overview of some of the problems I have ran into while porting applications and toolkits to the Mir display server&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How do we get existing applications to run on a modern display server? You port them! Some problems, what assumptions are made based on linux? Does it already support EGL? Should you use compile time or dynamic platform suppoert? What kind of threading is going on? How decoupled is the rendering/event handling code? Will it run on arm/x86 or more? Is upstream interested in this type of patch?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an overview of some of the problems I have ran into while porting applications and toolkits to the Mir display server. These are common issues you would run into when porting to Wayland as well. My goals are to port as many applications as I can, while providing real world examples to help others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Got an 8 or 16-bit antiquity in your cupboard? You can find a Free Software desktop for it! From Contiki to MiNT, AROS and others, there's one for every machine.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;C64, Apple II... those old machines gathering dust can run Free Software. The Contiki Operating System even provides a multitasking desktop and a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the Atari and Amiga 16-bit machines all have FLOSS OSes and desktops you can try (or "almost" like RiscOS (non-commercial license)), and FLOSS applications like the NetSurf web browser to run on them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Haiku, a free software OS, includes its own desktop, largely inspired by the BeOS. While it has a quite classic look, it still has some unique features.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite being 15 years old, Haiku still has some nice things to show off and inspire others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From x-ray navigation to multithreaded-by-default applications, Haiku is meant to be responsive even on older machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also discuss how Haiku can relate to XDG standards, considering it doesn't use X11, is not a Unix clone, and also has its share of legacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This talk will highlight the lessons learned from creating Zorin OS and the Zorin Desktop environment, how various optimisations have made our Linux desktop even more approachable and how the wider community can work together to spread the power of Linux to new classes of users around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past 25 years Linux has slowly dominated nearly every class of device – from the ubiquitous smartphone to the servers that run the world. However, the desktop computer has remained the elusive form factor for Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Linux desktop has matured over the years to be more user-friendly, but it has yet to fully cross the threshold to become a true mainstream platform. Is this because we need to work more on the technology, or is it that we need to ask ourselves different questions about the goals behind our FLOSS desktop projects?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Join us to discover how we combined HTML, .NET, OAUTH2 and Containers technologies to create a Corporate Web Desktop, composed by several applications that can interact as one, big, mainframe system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk the attendees will discover:
1. How we evolved from Server-side rendering (ASP.NET...) to Client-side rendering, with Angular 1.X and Bootstrap, leveraging current skills. (And how our developers loved the change)
2. How we leveraged existing .NET knowledge to create simple REST Services that runs in Windows, Linux and Mac, thanks to Microsoft's Open Source effort with .NET Core and Docker support.
3. How easy Identity Server project (http://identityserver.github.io/) can handle the most common authentication and authorization relaying on OAUTH2.

        <subtitle>Using libertine to run deb-packaged, X11 applications in an all-snaps Ubuntu</subtitle>
        <track>Desktops</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Libertine is an application suite for installing and running classic applications in a confined environment. Using libertine allows us to use everyday applications which have not been ported over to a new packaging format or don't work natively with a new display server. Libertine has allowed us to take advantage of classic apps such as Firefox and LibreOffice in Ubuntu Touch, a version of Ubuntu for devices based on click packaging and Mir/Unity8. Ubuntu developers have recently unveiled snappy, a new kind of packaging system which keeps an application confined to a readonly filesystem with all of its dependencies managed internally. Since migrating applications to snaps is a manual process, we've been working on a libertine snap to give us the ability to use non-snap applications in an all-snaps Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lecture will start with an overview of why libertine is a necessary component for managing and launching deb-based applications on both a classic Mir/Unity8 system and a completely confined all-snaps Ubuntu. Then there will be a review of how libertine works in general through container management and application launching. Finally, these topics will come together with an explanation of the infrastructure required for libertine to operate in an all-snaps environment. There will be light code and tooling examples throughout, as well as a live demonstration of deb-based X applications running in a snap environment.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>From Gtk to Qt: An Strange Journey, part 2</title>
        <subtitle>The continuation of the original talk from Dirk Hohndel and Linus Torvalds about the port of Subsurface from Gtk to Qt, now with mobile in mind.</subtitle>
        <track>Desktops</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As subsurface evolved from a Gtk Application to a Qt one, cutting a quarter of the codebase while still gaining new functionalities, a new development proposal was done: "How do we get this desktop based application and run it on mobile, on a unified codebase?"&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How do we get a kernel developer application writed in kernel-style code for the desktop and make it universal, running in any operating system, mobile and desktop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this talk I'll present you piece-by-piece history on what we had when Subsurface started, the chalenges that kernel hackers faced when creating a desktop application and why the choice was made to port away from Gtk into Qt - even tougth the main developer of subsurface back then loathed C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the initial port to Desktop a new era began, the era of Mobile Applications, and Qt had launched it's new Qml language that promissed good integration on mobile and even desktop with minimal effort. We wanted to give it a try. At the same time the KDE hackers launched a new idea "Kirigami", a library build on Qml to simplify development of Qml based software, and since we where already on the bleeding edge of things, why not give it a try?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the tale of Subsurface, From Gtk to Qt to Mobile, from one of it's main hackers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated 3D world where the users are immersed. Having a pretty dynamic coverage, the VR can be either on Web - where the app can run on a browser or it can be used as package.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A frame JS-A-Frame is an open-source WebVR framework for creating virtual reality (VR) experiences with HTML. We can build VR scenes that work across smartphones, desktop, the Oculus Rift, and the room-scale HTC Vive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three.js - Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library/API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Three.js uses WebGL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fedora KDE and Gnome being the best ones to go with (mostly because of the latest kernel 4.8.0 and nightly firefox)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We will be using these two JS libs to create VR contents. The participants will mostly understand how they can build scenes using a frame entity and a frame assets .  Aframe is open sourced and is easy to hack upon. Under the hood a-frame.js uses Three.js . Today if you want to build VR content , you need to learn one or the other frameworks like for HTC Vive , one has to learn Open VR so on and so forth. The Web VR platform , leverages the basic skillset of HTML5,CSS3 and JS to give a feel of Virtual Reality Application. While working with bleeding edge , we should always prefer a Desktop which will be stable yet flexible enough for development.  One particular demo would be to take a 2D video and make it videosphere giving it a Augmented reality feel. The demo can be found on my github [webvrdemo.github.io] . This is going to be a How to talk and by the end of the talk participants will be able to build something cool . Here's my blog to explain the steps [http://sumantrom.blogspot.in/2016/08/webvr-in-fedora-25-pre-release.html]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will go through an end-to-end web request. Based on an open source web application deployed in a hosting company, we will analyze many open source software that composes a web request.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Using Chromium as the user browser, we will understand what it does when a URL is typed and how it resolves the domain. DNS and UDP protocols will be explained in order to get the server IP. The IP received from DNS will be used to create a TCP connection to the server and we will understand how the three-way handshake works for that matter. Instead of using only the HTTP protocol, this connection will use HTTPS and we will analyze the TLS handshake as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the user local network to the hosting server, there are many routes to follow and we will analyze some of them (including a little bit of Wi-Fi). Getting to the server we will understand how the web server receives the request and forward to the web application. Web application talks to the web framework and your application that creates the HTML response. Everything will be assembled and return to the web browser that will process and render everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the entire process, we will point to open source code whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Audience&lt;/h2&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Kube is a beautiful, modern communication in a reliable, high-performance native groupware application for your desktop, laptop and mobile devices&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kube is a next-gen communication and collaboration client built with QtQuick on top of a high performance, low resource usage core. It provides online and offline access to all your mail, contacts, calendars, notes, todo's and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a strong focus on usability, the team works with designers and UX experts from the ground up, to build a product that is not only visually appealing but also a joy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the initial focus is on Linux, the desktop and email, the platform is built to run on all desktop systems as well as on mobile devices. It will eventually evolve into a full collaboration client including contacts, calendars, notes, todos, instant messaging etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is giving an overview of what Kube is and strives to be, along with some history why this effort has been started in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will go into some technical detail, but is suitable for anyone interested in an alternative to the currently existing groupware clients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Instead of speaking about successful parts of the projects, this talk will focus
on the weakness of both OpenBSD and FreeBSD, exploring conceptual differences
between them and also exploring directions where motivated contributors can
start working on to improve the projects.
While being general purpose operating systems we will see that one size doesn't
fit all and how one or the other may be a better solution to a particular
problem.

        <subtitle>Booting FreeBSD from encrypted disk</subtitle>
        <track>BSD</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD has supported disk encryption with GBDE and GELI since 2002 and 2005 respectively. However, booting the system required storing the loader and kernel unencrypted so that the requisite GEOM module could be loaded to handle decryption. This became a significantly larger stumbling block with the introduction of ZFS, as having multiple separate partitions detracts from the advantages of ZFS, and also causes headaches when upgrading the operating system. With the growing popularity of ZFS Boot Environments, a solution was needed that allowed the kernel and loader to remain part of the primary file system, even if it was encrypted. This paper provides an overview of the design of the GELI enabled BIOS boot code and loader, as well as the numerous challenges encountered during their development.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A walk through the tale of woe that was implementing support for GELI in the FreeBSD bootcode and loader. Hear the story of a very junior developer persisting through countless complications and roadblocks to finally arrive at working code. Learn just how complicated it is to boot a computer, and how much worse it can get. In the end, we are left with working ZFS Boot Environments, even with fully encrypted pools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Internet Transport is changing, some changes have been incremental updates to
mechanisms (e.g., RACK, BBR), others demand new protocol options (e.g., MPTCP)
or entirely new protocols (e.g., QUIC, SCTP). However significant changes are
still difficult to deploy - requiring modifications to application code and
support by the stack. Even when updates happen, the network needs to support
the new method to allow applications to use it. Long deployment times have
motivated the need to change how protocols are handled in the stack. We review
the state of the art in Internet Transport, and the status of deployment in th
BSD's and then propose a new direction for the transport interface, developed
in the EU NEAT Project, that can ease deployment of new transports across all
platforms. We conclude by showing the advantages and its prospects for
standards adoption.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <title>CloudABI for FreeBSD: how does it work?</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>BSD</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;One of the fundamental problems with UNIX-like operating systems is that they don't seem to make it easy and intuitive to develop applications that are strongly hardened against exploits through sandboxing. With CloudABI, we're trying to make this process a lot easier, by having an environment that is purely based on capability-based security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another talk in the main track I'm going to give a more general talk about CloudABI, explaining what the mindset behind the project. During this talk in the BSD devroom I want to focus on one specific aspect, namely how FreeBSD's runtime environment for CloudABI works.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;CloudABI is a simplified POSIX-like runtime environment that is inspired by FreeBSD's Capsicum. It allows you to create programs that can solely interact with the environment through file descriptors (capabilities). Compared to traditional UNIX-like systems, this approach has three advantages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It reduces the impact of exploits. If an attacker manages to take over control of a CloudABI application, it can only access those resources that the application was designed to use (for a networked service: typically an already bound TCP socket and some data directories). This is different from most traditional UNIX-like systems, where an attacker would gain access to all resources that the user running the application can access, which is very broad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes applications easier to test. By knowing that an application can only access those resources that are provided explicitly, the entire environment in which the application runs can be customized for testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, it makes applications easier to deploy. This model tends to reduce the need for using containers and virtual machines. Applications can be started directly, while still providing the necessary isolation from the rest of the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An interesting aspect of CloudABI is that it's cross-platform. You can compile a CloudABI program once and run exactly the same executable both on FreeBSD, macOS and Linux. In this talk I want to focus on this specifically: how is FreeBSD capable of running these programs? Topics I'll be covering during this talk include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FreeBSD's image activator framework: the code that parses and loads executables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ELF file format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System calls and system call tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vDSOs: Virtual Dynamic Shared Objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Containers are great in terms of application packaging and delivery, but there’s a lot of noise in the space. But when it comes to multi-container applications, most production setups use advanced container orchestration technologies like Kubernetes, Openshift, Mesos/Marathon, which are not that developer friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers prefer docker-compose for its simplicity. This talk will showcase our ongoing efforts at Red Hat, Skippbox and Google to bridge this gap between deploying containers in development to production, and the need to standardize a multiple container definition spec which works seamlessly across different environments and container orchestration platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Containers are everywhere now a days. We want to use containers during development, in staging, in production, etc. However, it’s not that straight forward, thanks to the plethora of container runtimes and toolchains. Some are developer friendly, whereas, others, which are battle tested for production, are not that developer friendly. In this talk we’ll walk you through the current state of things for containers in various environments: development, production, etc., the disparity between container technologies usually used in development and production, how to take things from development to production, etc. This will showcase how Red Hat, Skippbox and Google have been working to solve this problem, and the result of that work is a CLI tool called Kompose, https://github.com/skippbox/kompose. Kompose takes in docker-compose file format and generates Kubernetes and OpenShift artifacts. However, is it enough? We need a standardized specification to define multi container applications that works seamlessly across multiple container runtimes and orchestration tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will be organized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developer workflow with containers
Container technologies preferred in production
What it takes to have a production like environment for development? So much to learn!
Pushing application to production with 0 (or little) learning curve
Kompose: Tool to move from docker-compose to Kubernetes
What next?
A standard specification to define multi-container application
Road to container Utopia&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;gRPC is a high performance, open source, general RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first. gRPC is based on many years of Google's experience in building distributed systems - it is designed to be low latency, bandwidth and CPU efficient, to create massively distributed systems that span data centers, as well as power mobile apps, real-time communications, IoT devices and APIs. It's also interoperable between multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But beyond that fact that it's more efficient than REST, we'll look into how to use gRPC's streaming API, where you can establish server-side streaming, client-side streaming, and bidirectional streaming! This allows developers to build sophisticated real-time applications with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to learning about gRPC and HTTP/2 concepts with code and demonstrations, we'll also deep dive into integration with existing build systems such as Maven and Gralde, but also frameworks such as Spring Boot and RxJava.
 - Configuring projects to generate gRPC stub code
 - Using Protobuf3 to define services
 - Creating synchronous and asynchronous services, with streaming.
 - Load balancing
 - Interceptors&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Kubernetes container orchestrator can scale and connect stateless applications quite easily. Stateful applications require more work. Databases, caching systems, and file stores are harder to dynamically manage with data intact, and sometimes come with their own notion of clustering. Operators automate these tasks. Operators are Kubernetes agents that know how to deploy, scale, manage, and even upgrade complex applications.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

Operators are Kubernetes agents that know how to deploy, scale, manage, and even upgrade complex applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we'll illustrate the Operator concept, showing how Operators are built atop the Kubernetes third-party resources mechanism with a close examination of the open source etcd Operator. We'll demonstrate the Operator in action, deploying an etcd key-value store cluster atop Kubernetes, then scaling and replicating etcd pods in response to load and in the face of pod and node failures. The audience will learn how to deploy the etcd Operator and how to begin developing Operators to manage their own stateful applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;User namespaces are designed to safely delegate a set of sub-uids (for instance, 100000-200000) to an unprivileged user. The sub-uids may be mapped to any uids in a new user namespace, and the mapped uid 0 in the new namespace is privileged over all mapped sub-uids.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;User namespaces are designed to safely delegate a set of sub-uids (for instance, 100000-200000) to an unprivileged user. The sub-uids may be mapped to any uids in a new user namespace, and the mapped uid 0 in the new namespace is privileged over all mapped sub-uids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;POSIX capabilities are designed to be completely orthogonal to uids. A "forced" POSIX capability assigned to a file confers that privilege to any user, regardless of uid, who executes that file. This makes it inherently unsafe to allow root in a user namespace to assign file capabilities, since an unprivileged user could create a user namespace, assign a capability to some file, then execute the file in the initial user namespace with elevated privilege. This is a problem for distributions which wish to simplify services requiring limited privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;OpenShift version 3 is an open-source Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) based on docker-formatted container images and the Kubernetes project. Kubernetes is an open-source project for orchestration, deployment automation, auto-scaling, and management of containerized applications. OpenShift combines all of the benefits of docker and Kubernetes and adds features like automatic image building, a local docker registry, storage integration, networking, and Continous Integration (CI) tools such as Jenkins, to deliver a platform for Continuous Delivery (CD). Simply put, just bring your application code and OpenShift will build the required Docker images and run the application on OpenShift with Kubernetes. OpenShift is also ideal for deploying the microservices that containers make so easy to implement.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;This talk will include introduction to OpenShift, talk and demo about how developers can quickly setup OpenShift using Atomic Developer Bundle [1] and minishift [2] and on their workstation and use it to develop their applications and then move them through testing, staging and production. I will talk about how Openshift benefits from Kubernetes and Docker and the possible workflows to use when you want to deploy an application. The demo will also include of deploying and scaling an application in OpenShift.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Singularity is an open source container solution being developed specifically for HPC environments. With Singularity, HPC users can safely bring their own execution environments to the cluster. Unlike other container solutions, Singularity does not require root level permissions to run containers, which allows users to freely control what software stack they wish to use. Provisioning of a container image can be done locally on the user's machine or on Singularity Hub. The resulting image can then be securely executed on any machine with Singularity installed. Reproduction of results has never been easier: a user can now share a single Singularity image file that will ensure a consistent execution environment wherever it is run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will provide an in-depth look at how Singularity is able to securely run user containers on HPC systems. After a brief introduction to Singularity and its relationship to other container solutions, the details of Singularity's runtime will be explored. The way that Singularity leverages Linux features such as namespaces, bind mounts, and SUID binaries will be discussed in further detail as well.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;System-on-Chip vendors typically provide a board support package (BSP) which should be a good starting point to develop the software for an embedded Linux system. However they often seem to misunderstand what the software designers want, and deliver something that makes their life harder without any apparent benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk Luca will share some of his experiences with such vendor BSPs, featuring jurassic kernels, non-working drivers, non-existing bootloaders, code of appallingly bad quality, ineffective customer support and Windows-only tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will discover why he spent weeks in understanding, fixing and working around BSPs instead of just using them. The effects on the final product quality will be described as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luca will also discuss what the options are when you face such a BSP, and what both hackers and vendors can do to improve the situation for everybody's benefit.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;SIL2LinuxMP strives to qualify a defined GNU/Linux subset for the use in
safety-related systems by "assessment of non-compliant development". To
demonstrate that the kernel has achieved suitable reliability and correctness
properties basic metrics of such properties and their statistic analysis can
be used as part of the argument. While IEC 61508 Ed 2 always pairs testing
and analysis, we believe that for a high complexity system traditional
testing is of relatively low effectiveness and analytical methods need to be
the primary path.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;SIL2LinuxMP strives to qualify a defined GNU/Linux subset for the use in
safety-related systems by "assessment of non-compliant development". To
demonstrate that the kernel has achieved suitable reliability and correctness
properties basic metrics of such properties and their statistic analysis can
be used as part of the argument. Linux has a wealth of analytical tools
built-in to it which allow to extract information on compliance, robustness
of development, as well as basic metrics on complexity or correctness with
respect to defined properties. While IEC 61508 Ed 2 always pairs testing
and analysis, we believe that for a high complexity system traditional
testing is of relatively low effectiveness and analytical methods need to be
the primary path. To this ends we outline some approaches taken:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug-age analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bug-rates and trend analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code-complexity/bug relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brain-dead correctness analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interface and type-correctness analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API compliance analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis of build-bot data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While much of the data points to robust and mature code there also are some
areas where problems popped up. In this talk we outline the used methods and
give examples as well as key findings. FLOSS development has reached a quite
impressive maturity, to substantially go beyond we think it will need the
use of quantitative process and code metrics - these results from SIL2LinuxMP
may be a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Loco Positioning: An OpenSource Local Positioning System for robotics</title>
        <subtitle>Presentation with a demo of autonomous Crazylfie 2.0 quadcopter</subtitle>
        <track>Embedded, mobile and automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Positioning in robotics has alway been a challenge. For outdoor,
robots GPS is solving most of the practical problems, but indoor,
precise localization is still done using expensive proprietary systems mainly
based on an array of cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will present the loco positioning system: an open source Ultra
Wide Band radio-based local positioning system, why we need it and how it works.
I will also speak about its usage with the Crazyflie 2.0 open source  nano
quadcopter, of course ending with an autonomous flying demo.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I am Arnaud Taffanel, co-founder of Bitcraze. Bitcraze is designing and making
the Crazyflie 2.0 nano quadcopter, a flying open source development platform. We
are designing, making and selling hardware platforms and releasing all software
as open source projects on Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of the Crazyflie project, when it was still an after-work fun
project, we were dreaming of a Local Positioning System that would allows us to
fly the quadcopter autonomously. For years, the only viable
solutions where very expensive camera-based motion capture systems. We have been
assisting researchers using the Crazyflie with this kind of system but it was
out of our reach and out of reach for most of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, we discovered that a company, Decawave, had released an
ultra-wide-band radio module that would allows us to build an Local Positioning
System for a fraction of the price of the motion captures system. This became
the Loco Positioning System and it is still under heavy development with the
help the community. The Loco Positioning System hardware has been released last
summer in "early access" which means that the hardware was finished and tested
but that much of the software and algorithm were still under development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have a flying system. With the help of researchers and industrials, we
are starting to have state-of-the art algorithm for position estimation and
autonomous flight. Currently the main users for the LPS  and Crazyflie are
universities for research and education, technical artists for
shows and industrials for research and tech demos. In the future, technologies
and algorithm developed for the LPS will be used for even-more affordable
positioning system (for example based on webcams) to allow anyone to play with
autonomous flying platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My preliminary plan for the presentation is:
 - Presentation of myself and Bitcraze
 - State of the localization technologies for robotics
 - What UWB radio is and how it can solve localization
 - How does localization using UWB radios works
 - How our system is implemented with a presentation of the Crazyflie 2.0
 - Flight demo of one or many Crazylfies autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Device Tailored Compositors with the QtWayland Compositor Framework</title>
        <subtitle/>
        <track>Embedded, mobile and automotive</track>
        <type>devroom</type>
        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will give an introduction into the QtWayland Compositor framework and show how to use it to create a Wayland compositor from scratch. The QtWayland Compositor API is rather new and just got its first stable release with Qt 5.8. It can be used to create Wayland compositors from scratch within only a few hours and completely adapt them to the UI concept of your embedded device. My talk focus on how to use the framework within a complex multi-application automotive scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Wayland is today's standard to perform window compositing on embedded Linux devices. In cars, one typically uses the automotive specific "IVI" protocol extension to talk to the compositor. This works well if you have a UI with only limited window dynamics or animations, like a static display of windows from different processes (e.g. display consisting of a radio control window, a climate control window...). But if you want to add fancy window animations and/or have a certain complex workflow for your UI in mind, the IVI protocol shows its limits. However, writing your own Wayland compositor is no option in such a case due to the amount of work and the introduced complexity/bugs. In this talk, I will explain why and when the QtWayland Compositor Framework provides you with a new alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The QtWayland Compositor API, which only recently entered the realm of stable released Qt API, makes it almost trivial to create your own Wayland compositor. Even adding your own protocol extensions, for which your UX designers can add any fancy (QtQuick) animation you can dream of, is simple. In my talk, I will give an introduction into the QtWayland Compositor framework and show how to use it to create a Wayland compositor from scratch. I will focus on my own experience as an embedded device developer from using the framework in real-life automotive scenarios. However, like most people in the embedded world, I cannot directly talk about my projects, but instead will talk about a hypothetical "Kitchen HMI" project, which yet will cover the full complexity of a multi-application device. Specifically, this Kitchen HMI will feature the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The windows from different example applications (clock app, tea cooking timer app, egg cooking timer app) will be composed in a uniform UI by a QtWayland based Wayland compositor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The compositor provides a custom protocol extension for alarming ("hey, your tea is ready!").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The windows will have nice animations, actually you can handle them the same as QtQuick items in the canvas of a QtQuick application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Attending the talk will provide you with the required knowledge to do all of the above on your own and specifically show that window handling in a QtWayland compositor "feels" the same like doing simple declarative QtQuick UI development.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Linaro Automated Validation Architecture (LAVA) is without a doubt one of the best currently available tools for managing board farms. It is proven to be quite a handy tool for both developers and tests automation engineers. Although it is provided together with extensive documentation, creating first own laboratory might be a challenging task. Does it have to be for every newcomer? During this talk Paweł will guide through the process of setting up own LAVA instance. Starting from LAVA installation, through common post-install tasks, up to running first tests on a brand new board farm.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk will provide an introduction to setting up and maintaining LAVA laboratory. Presentation aims at breaking barriers between novice users and the technology itself. Paweł will also present how to manage LAVA configuration and how to easily make deployments automated and reproducible. Materials shared during this talk focus on providing starting points for both beginners and experienced LAVA administrators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <language/>
        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;LAVA and Fuego are great tools individually already. Combining and extending them allows for a much broader test coverage than each tool alone can provide. In this presentation, Jan-Simon Möller will present the features of the combined infrastructure and highlight the tools and work done to integrate both tools. Also in focus is how to distribute the test infrastructure across multiple sites to include more boards. In the end we'll discuss the lessons learned and future developments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The focus of this talk is to share the experiences made and lessons learned so ppl can integrate such tools better in their own environment. It also raises the pain-points and open issues when setting up a distributed environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially for Automotive, Long-Term-Support, CIP or Consumer Electronics, advancing the Test-harness is essential to raise the bar and strengthen the confidence in our embedded platforms. Automated testing can improve our ecosystem from two sides: during development (feature does work &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; does not break things) and during maintenance (no regressions through backports).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Adding support for IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN to an embedded Linux board opens
up new possibilities to communicate with tiny devices. The mainline kernel
supports the wireless protocols to connect such devices to the internet, acting
as border router for such networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will show how to add the needed transceiver to existing hardware,
how to enable and configure the kernel subsystems to use it and how to
communicate between Linux and IoT operating systems like RIOT or Contiki.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Adding support for IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN to an embedded Linux board opens
up new possibilities to communicate with tiny, IoT type of, devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing IP connectivity to devices, like sensors, with just a few kilobytes of
RAM and limited battery power is an interesting IoT challenge. With the
Linux-wpan and 6LoWPAN subsystems we get Linux ready to support the needed
wireless standards as well as protocols that connect these tiny devices into the
wider internet. To make Linux a practical border router or smart home hub for
such networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will show how to add the needed transceiver hardware to an existing
hardware and how to enable and configure the Linux-wpan and 6LoWPAN mainline
subsystems to use it. The demonstration will include setting up the
communication between Linux and other popular IoT operating systems like RIOT
or Contiki as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Industrial Ethernet is a successor of classic field bus such as CAN, MODBUS or
PROFIBUS.
POWERLINK was created by B&amp;amp;R Automation and provides performance and real­time capabilities based on standard Ethernet hardware.
openPOWERLINK is open source and runs on lots of platforms such as Linux, Windows, various RTOS and dedicated hardware (FPGA).
We will explain how to use openPOWERLINK on top of Xenomai 3, a powerful realtime extension for Linux kernel based on co-­kernel technology.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Current version of openPOWERLINK runs on Linux with (or without) PREEMPR_RT patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xenomai is an alternative to PREEMPT_RT. It's not a single patch for the Linux kernel but runs as a dual kernel (Linux and Cobalt) on top of a micro-kernel (ADEOS/I-pipe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the 2nd version of conference about openPOWERLINK/Xenomai as the port works now on the famous BeagleBone Black board running Linux (Buildroot based distro) or Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation will introduce openPOWERLINK as an alternate - and open source - solution to proprietary products such as EtherCAT.&lt;br/&gt;
We will introduce Xenomai and explain how to integrate the openPOWERLINK stack with Xenomai 3.0.
Finally we will compare Xenomai and PREEMPT_RT version running on the same hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
